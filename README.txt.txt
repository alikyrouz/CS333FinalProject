README.txt

This code is unfortunately not that complicated. If running OCR to create text file first, put any files to read in in an image format and install pytesseract and PIL. This code opens the image files from a folder, processes each, and writes text to a document called outputs.txt.


To run the BookNLP program, install booknlp, and possibly en_core_web_sm in spacy. This should already be there but there are multiple other users who had a problem with it. I set multiple parameters, but only ended up using the outputs in supersense, and some in tokens for reference. This program uses an input text file, and outputs multiple text files generated by BookNLP to an output location.
