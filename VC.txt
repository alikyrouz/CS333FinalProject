THIS IS AN OLD DINER like the ones Cody and his father ate in, long
ago, with that oldfashioned railroad car ceiling and sliding doors  the
board where bread is cut is worn down fine as if with bread dust and a
plane; the icebox ( Say I got some nice homefries tonight Cody! ) is a
huge brownwood thing with oldfashioned pull-out handles, windows,
tile walls, full of lovely pans of eggs, butter pats, piles of bacon old
lunchearts always have a dish of sliced raw onions ready to go on ham-
burgs. Grill is ancient and dark and emits an odor which is really suc-
culent, like you would expect from the black hide of an old ham or an old
pastrami beef  Thelunchcart has stools with smooth slickwood tops  
thereare wooden drawers for where you find the long loaves of sandwich
bread  The countermen: either Greeks or have big red drink noses.
Coffee is served in white porcelain mugs sometimes brown and
cracked. An old pot with a half inch of black fat sits on the grill, with a

(3)
wire fryer (also caked) sitting in it, ready for french fries  Melted fat
is kept warm in an old smail white coffee pot. A zinc siding behind the
grill gleams from the brush of rags over fat stains   The cash register
has a wooden drawer as old as the wood of a rolltop desk. The newest
things are the steam cabinet, the aluminum coffee urns, the floor fans  
But the marble counter is ancient, cracked, marked, carved, and under
it is the old wood counter of late twenties, early thirties, which had
come to look like the bottoms of old courtroom benches only with knife-
marks and scars and something suggesting decades of delicious greasy
food. Ah!

The smell is always of boiling water mixed with beef, boiling beef,
like the smell of the great kitchens of parochial boarding schools or old
hospitals, the brown basement kitchens  smell the smell is curiously
the hungriest in America  it is FOODY insteady of just spicy, or it s
like dishwater soap just washed a pan of hamburg nameless 
memoried   sincere   makes the guts of men curl in October.

THE CAPRICIO B-MOVIE: the glass facings on the marquee, over
which the movable letters are slid, are in places broken so that you can
see bulbs inside and some of the bulbs broken; further the letters always
misspell Short Subjets etc. Alwa ystwo big features (the letters
misplaced as well) so that from a distance you see this spotty marquee
(it is supported from the brick face of the building by iron black sooty
hooks and bars just behind marquee top a nameless window with a
dusty heavy wire screen, probably projection room) from a distance
you can t read it and it's been spelled out by crazy dumb kids who earn
eighteen dollars a week and know Cody and it looks like a B-movie. The
sidewalk in front is dirty, has banana peels and the old splashmarks
of puke or broken milk bottles   the lobby has a tile floor-~a torn rubber
carpet leading to ticket box, which is as ornate as something from a
carnival and curlicued and painted gaudy orange-brown (just because
for tickets); bespectacled middleaged Jewish proprietor takes tickets.
The pictures in the sidewall slides are always the same, terrible B-
movies  twelve installment serials, western or fantastic and cheap 
Negro boys spar in front. Across the street is an old beat gas station 
diner on the other corner   right next to movie is a hotdog-Coke-maga-
zine establishment with a big scarred Coca-Cola sign at base of an open
counter topped by a marble now so old that it has turned gray and
chipped, covered with bottles of syrup to make soda drinks and ad cards
and junk, and beneath, an ancient woodflap once used to close place at
night, now nailed under Coca-Cola, is so weatherbeaten and old, and
was once painted brown, that it now has a shapeless color like shit
against the gray, almost shit-gray sidewalk which is covered with butts

(4)

and gumwrappers itself. This is the bottom of the world, where little
raggedy Codys dream, as rich men plan gleaming plastic auditoriums
and soaring glass fronts on Park Avenue and the rich districts of Denver
and the world. .

IN THE AUTUMN OF 1951 I began thinking of Cody Pomeray, thinking
of Cody Pomeray. We had been great buddies on the road. I was in New
York and I wanted to go to California and see him, but I had no money.
I'm in an old El station on Third Avenue and 47th, sitting in wooden
sunken-seat benches along the walls the Porter sign in the door is al-
most all faded  In the raw wood wall a strange beautiful window with
blue and red stained glass fringes  two bare bulbs on each side of it 
the floor old worn planks  ~ the whole place shakes as the train approach-
es. A huge old iron potbelly stove, its iron showing through grayish (not
polished for years)  the stovepipe goes up four feet then over seven feet
(climbing slightly) then up two feet to disappear into the fantastic ceil-
ing of carved wood, into some kind of chimney flue characterized by a
circular cover with carved openings  the stove sits on an ancient pad,
and the floor sags away from it. At the wall tops along ceiling are carved
raw buttresses like in Victorian porches. The place is so brown that any
light looks brown in it   It s fit for the sorrows of winter night and re-
minds me speechlessly of old blizzards when my father was ten, of   88"
or some such and of old workmen spitting and Cody s father. Qutside 
sprawling  alpine lodge  crazy crooked wood house with fringes,
weathervane tower, vane itself, pale shapeless snot green, stained with
ages of rain and snow, onetime red (now forlorn hint of red) tower ~
fringes elaborate as hell timbers on tracks are splintered and aged be-
yond recognition.

AND OVER AT THIRD AVENUE AND 9th STREET is @ beat employ-
ment agency, it s over a music store which (Western Music Co.) has a
dirty piss splashed and littered sooty sidewalk in front, and iron cellar
sidewalk doors alse filthy and sag when you walk over. Western Music
Co, written in white against green glass with lights behind but so sooty
is the white part it makes a dirty sad effect.

Old newspapers and old paper container tops, piled up in corner of
door, maybe by bum, wind or child. In the window is a big bass drum,
used, faded  saxes old fiddles ~ Tuba sitting on tinfoil (attempt to
brighten window sensationally, drastically like they do in wildest mod-
ern stores). Bongos   guitar  regularold black and white linoleum (one-
foot squares) is bottom of show window. Entrance to W.E.A. is to left  
Sign is long vertical wedge sign, black on yellow, says Central Employ-
ment Agency   Black with dust planking is hall leading in  Sign says

(8)
(34 is the number)  chefs, cooks, bakers, waiters, bartenders, etc. 
In the office (brown light) sits a shirtsleeve vest brownsuit boss at desk
(with bowtie, cropped gray hair) as two beat clients wait in blue leather
chairs  one of them is old white-hair guy in Scandinavian ski sweater.
Other is dark, beat Greek in dark suit offset by white shirt and blue
snazzy tie  An unused desk among the three altogether has a green
blotter on it torn in middle, raveled up, showing undercardboard  
rough plaster stonewalls are painted brown and yellow  folded news-
papers lie about third beat guy being interviewed, sits on radiator
covering with back to big plate glass window that faces old E! station
where watchers linger for nothing (or for next door weird factory shop
where fat men in aprons are making labels for dolls). Boss uses phone,
guy sitting (with open sports collar and Army-Navy Store suit) big, like
boxer, waits all hunched forward with palms on knees  

Building is ancient red 1880 redbrick three stories over its
roof I can see cosmic Italian oldfashioned eighteen-story office block
building with ornaments and blueprint lights inside that reminds me of
eternity, the enormous house of dusk where everybody is putting on
their coats   and going down black stairs like fire escapes to eat supper
in the dungeon of Time underneath just a few feet over the Snake  and
Doctor Sax clambers over the wallsides as night falls, with his suction
cups and the superintendent is sleeping.

Meanwhile, next door to the music store is a shoe repair, closed and
dark now, then the Harmony Bar and Grillincrimson neon upon the gray
sidewalk.

THE MEN'S ROOM in Third Avenue El has wood walls painted green
(for wainscot effect this), yellow up to old carved wooden ceiling 
stench of piss is like ammonia   piss in urinal sloshes as train, arriving,
shakes the place high on wall where yellow paint is, a big coathook
decked with soot (like snow that's fallen on a twig) and fully a foot long,
like seeing an enormous cockroach  and too high to reach  toilet bowl
has oldfashioned outhouse plank with hole to lower bow! strangely
surrounded by a fence of piping, like a park ~same stained glass win-
dow but unwashed and has chain you pull it open with, like flushing
out The wainscot effect of dark then yellow up to ceiling is also to be
found in the clock-tocking reading rooms of flophouses like the Skylark
in Denver where Cody and his father stayed where bums sit on creaky
chairs and with their cloth caps settin straight on their heads and still
covered with grease spots probably from Montana they grimly read the
papers to show that tonight they are not goofing in no alleys with rotgut
and in fact they've just eaten supper in the restaurant with all the cheap
prices soaped-in on the plate glass windows  Soup, 5 , Italian spe-

(6)

ghetti, 20 , knockwurst and beans, 25  (bent over their plates and
gobbled food with big grimy sad hands, gripping, old cloth capped heads
bentin pitiful congregation, the needs and necessities, no  dining  here)
in fact the most woebegone bignosed bum in the world, enormous red
nose that in fact he snicked out as he came out of the eatery to cap the
horror of it~ a big clown caricature of the Hawk ~ had eaten 20  worth
 cause | saw him lay it on the counter and let it go reluctantly, spaghetti
or the vegetable dinner plate, portions seemed to be awright inside, three
slices of bread not two, I saw heaps of boiled potatoes alongside meat
as those heartbreaking poor guys in their inconceivable clothes, World-
War-l Army greatooats, black baseball caps too small like Cody's father s
with a witless peak, leaned elbows over their humble meals of grime 
1 saw the flash of their mouths, like the mouths of minstrels, as they
ate... the bignose bum moved away from his 20  at a very (pitiful
tomato  salads ) slow, slow shuffle, sort of eased himself from the area
of the restaurant to the area of the sidewalk, where in the chill October
with winter coming he shuffled right along in his white shirtsleeves
nothing else and drab pants like the pants of Dutch bums in windmills
and dung, his head bent as if from the weight of the immense melancholy
nose(twiceas big as W.C. Fieldsi)  (no hope,  no-good  pedestrians on
all sides). The wainscots of flophouses  I was amazed by them  adven-
turous slouched hats   ages of rain make their brims roll up and down
willy-nilly and yet just because it s these damn old cowboys wearing
them the hats retain immense indefinable charm of the wideopen free
sprawling America of railroads and distant mesas that Australian,
that pioneer, that frontier dash is worked in by the rain  on their slant-
ed farlooking heads. And they are adventurous, one guy ageinst the wall
has same look you see on kid of eleven having first cornsilk butt along
garage wall after supper in the interesting darkness in Eau Claire, Wis-
consin   same wickedness, as if the world was his mother remonstrat-
ing with him  same look of adventuring you see on young truckdrivers
when they stop atalonely junction Coke stand at night in Texas and their
enormous truck-trailer sits waiting for them huge across the road, with
aspare tire regardant under the cab like the ram shield on a Dodge radia-
tor cap  the flying billy ram of travel and both of  em dirty and grim
and come a long way and quiet and Henry-Fonda-like and talk to each
other that you can t hear and when they leave together they move with
the same sadness as if their adventure together was persecuting them to
grieve the same careful way and off they go into their own night beyond
the whatevers of where you who watch them still stay, they are gone
yonder never to come back again and have come and gone like ghosts
across your eyes and the bums have that same grave, careful adventur-
ous sorrow as they stand stiffly before an alley wall looking straight

(1)
ahead with their eyes and their drinkwet mouths glistening in the moon-
light in a lunar Bowery, spitting or saying  Hey sport, gimme a dime for
agoddamn cup of coffee,  and init there is a statement  I've come along,
long way to be standing against this wall stranger and you ought to
"preciate the troubles I ve had and the miles I done   cause after all I'm
froma Houston and you're a damn New Yorker that ain t never been to
God's country Texas   

WELL, MASTURBATION. There's absolutely no sense whatever in
lettin your pants down Alashittin and then, cause you're toolazy togetup,
or make other shifts, simply milk the cow (with appropriate thoughts)
andletthemilk at its sweet keen pitch spurt downward, between thighs,
when the urgeat that momentis upward, onward, out, straining, to make
everything comeout as though gathering it from all corners of the loins to
purse it out the shivering push bone  No, with the thing flapping and
milking below, notonly that the seat cover restricting the natural quiver-
bow jump of the cock at the great moment there is a sudden sorrow
 cause you can t push in, out, over, onward, at it but just sit dumbly
(like a man sits down to piss) oozing below for miserable hygiene and
convenience s sake in an awkward woebegone, in fact castrated with
legs-tangled-in-pants position and dumb shirt tails hanging 4 la shit 
and barely missing the real draining kick and ending up having done
nothing butclean out the loinsas ifyou d stucka dry rag in there and pull-
mopped out your life's desire. Well, Cody got to know that seon enough.

I WANDERED IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK and dreamed of
crossing the country again. I followed Victor, he was wearing a reaily
strange expensive coat like camel's hair, three-quarter length, with great
rich dark designs and yet strangely Christlike as a coat  walking in im-
mense long strides along Second Avenue  pretty sure Victor though
I didn t know he was so tall unless it was all those tremendously short
Italian mothers he was passing at his end of the sidewalk as I followed
made him so grand~long prophet strides carrying some package
wrapped in brown paper  headed east towards First Avenue  seemed
tobegoing slow but I had a hard time keeping up and I thinking  Good
thing I have my Proust  in case I should ever follow him all the way
which is apparently Paradise Alley over on the river they d see not only
how beat my copy is but that I seriously carry it around because I m
really reading it, really bemused in the streets with it like they'd be   
really a scholar, a hip mystic though they'd question my red October
shirtyet they wouldn't ~I'dsay"" Where's this Nory?  and he'd say  She's
my sister  and then I'd meet them and there d be silence and I guess

they'd wonder why I came, unless peeking at the subterraneans ain t .

(8)

never enough reason for them because I m  It would have to be joining
them in their own kind of sullen, if not sullen silently martyred almost
dull, calm, orreticence, or bourgeois stupidity, or probably great serious
saintly peace as in Victor's floating passage sweeping up the street as he
goes without even looking right or left and there goes a little kid following
him halfinjest, or accidentally but mainly I think in awe and maybe even
love as if Victor reminded him of Jesus too and being a kid he makes no
bones about wanting to crowd-up to the source of warmth and light  A
strange thing for an American to be doing in his adventure across these
years and specifically right now 1951  What ll they say about his
 career    what he's doing this moment  fifty years from now when he
shall have grown old and sepulchral in a new rest home somewhere
whereinterests are so far from Christlike subterranean Rimbaud motor-
cycle Provincetown kicks that I can t even estimate and his hallway
has worst possible martyring smell: the mash of apple wine - he climbed
his stairs, I heard doors close, thought maybe JC himself took shits,
pisses (and of course) but mainly could it be possible Victor takes a
lonely homecoming crap in a raw toilet of tenements and has the same
feelings I have as he sits looking at the pocked walls, smells same raw
danks, hears the same noises, has similar feet feelings and perhaps
 engourdissement  when he sits too long, and returns to his room (as
I do) with mind on kicks he brought home in package and desk things
~  solitary shifts of time and consciousness just like everybody
ise?

SO I SIT IN JAMAICA, LONG ISLAND in the night, thinking of Cody
and the road  happens to be a fog distant low of a klaxon moaning
horn  sudden swash of locomotive steam, either that or crash of steel
rods  a car washing by with the sound we all know from city dawns 
reminds me of Cambridge, Mass. at dawn and I didn t go to Harvard ~
Far far away a nameless purling or yowling of some kind done either by
(raised, vibroned) a train on a steel curve or skidding car grumble of a
truck coming  small truck, but has whistle tires in the mist a double
 bop bop  or  beep beep" from railyards, maybe soft application of big
Diesel whistle by engineer to acknowledge hiball-on-the-air from brake-
manor car knocker  the sound of the whole thing in general when there
are no specific near-sounds is of course sea-like but also almost like the
sound of the living structure, so as you look at a house you imagine it is
adding its breathing to the general loud hush ~ (ever so far, in the hush,
you can hear a tiny SQUEE of something, the nameless asthmas of the
throat of Time)  now a man, probably a truckdriver, is yelling far away
and sounds like an adventurous young fellow playing in the darkness 
the harmonies of air brakes stopping on two intervals, first application,

(9)
the sound of it melting and echoing the second application and harmoniz-
ing - A cluster of yellow November leaves in an otherwise bare and
sheepish castrated tree send up a little meek PLICK as they rub together
preparing to die. When I see a leaf fall, 1 always say goodbye  And that
has a sound which is lost unless there is country stillness at which time
I'm sure it really rattles the earth, like ants in orchestras   Moan, the
terrible sound now of the Public Address system in the Milk Factory, the
voice like it's coming out of a stovepipe full of screens and amplified 
avoicelikenight  a big steelrim cricket  (it's stopped)  I heard it once
so loud  Please turn off the water,  a woman, a rainy night, I was
shocked~- Acar door slamming, the click, the velvet modern hinge-click
before the soft slam  the soft cushioned new-car slam, flump some
man in hat and coat up to something pompous, secret, sheepish  The
area breathes; it seems to want to tell something intelligible to me 

WENT TO HECTOR , the glorious cafeteria of Cody's first New York
vision when he arrived in late 1946 all excited with his first wife; it made
me sad to realize. A glittering counter~-decorative walls  but nobody
notices noble old ceiling of ancient decorated in fact almost baroque
(Louis XV?) plaster now browned a smoky rich tan color  where chan-
deliers hung (obviously was old restaurant) now electric bulbs within
metal casings or shades   But general effect isof shiny foodon counter  
walls are therefore not toonoticeable  sections of ceiling-length mirrors,
and mirror pillars, give spacious strange feeling  brownwood panels
with coathooks and sections of rose-tint walls decorated with images,
engraved But ah the counter! as brilliant as B-way outside! Great
rows of it one vast L-shaped counter   great rows of diced mint jellos
in glasses; diced strawberry jellos gleaming red, jellos mixed with peach-
es and cherries, cherry jellos top't with whipcream, vanilla custards
top't with cream; great strawberry shortcakes already sliced in twelve
sections, illuminating the center of the L  Huge salads, cottage cheese,
pineapple, plums, egg salad, prunes, everything vast baked apples  
tumbling dishes of grapes, pale green and brown~ immense pans of
cheesecake, of raspberry cream cake, of flaky rich Napoleons, of simple
Boston cake, armies of  clairs, of enormously dark chocolate cake
(gleaming scatological brown) of deepdish strudel, of time and the
river of freshly baked powdered cookies of glazed strawberry-ba-
nana desserts  wild glazed orange cakes ~ pyramiding glazed desserts
made of raspberries, whipcream, lady fingers sticking up vast sec-
tions reserved for the splendors of coffee cakes and Danish crullers 
All interspersed with white bottles of rich mad milk  Then the bread
bun mountain   Then the serious business, the wild steaming fragrant
hot-plate counter -~ Roast lamb, roast loin of pork, roast sirloin of beef,

(10)

baked breast of lamb, stuff'd pepper, boiled chicken, stuff d spring
chicken, things to make the poor penniless mouth water   big sections of
meat fresh from ovens, and a great knife sitting alongside and the server
whe daintily lays out portions as thin as paper. The coffee counter, the
urs, the cream jet, the steam But most of all it s that shining glazed
sweet counter ~~ showering like heaven   an all-out promise of joy in the
great city of kicks.

But I haven't even mentioned the best of all the cold cuts and sand-
wich and salad counter   with pans of mountainous spreads of all kinds
that have cream cheese coverings sprinkled with chives and other bright
spices, the pink lovely looking lox   cold ham  Swiss cheese  the whole
counter gleaming with icy joy which is salty and nourishing  cold fish,
herrings, onions   great loaves of rye bread sliced so on  spreads of
all kinds, egg salads big enough for a giant decorated and sprigged on a
pan in great sensuous shapes   salmon salads  (Poor Cody, in front
of this in his scuffled-up beat Denver shoes, his literary  imitation  suit
he had wanted to wear to be acceptable in New York cafeterias which he
thought would be brown and plain like Denver cafeterias, with ordinary
food)  

THAT SENSE OF SPRING comes over us in the Indian Summer sub-
way station because of something warm (the sun upstairs) and yet dank
like leftover oozes of winter  like the wet boughs shining at three o'clock
in a March afternoon like G Street in Washington when I was young
and so ambled in imitation of Big Slim with short steps, erect and open-
minded and Howdy Pard, walked like that in the sun outside marquees
and shooting galleries and among orange peels of honkytonk life and
suddenly a dark cool feeling comes from an open cellar or maybe a river
breeze from Potomac, and it s Spring.

The subway lady is sitting on side bench holding Journal American
up with two blackgloved hands ~a funny Elly-like but aged (fifty-five)
face with glasses, looking oddly French-Canadian, like an aunt of mine
who pursed her lips the same way among the woodpiles of West Mass-
achussetts or North Maine on gray exhalation days of piney mist as her
sons stood arms akimbo in the yard  Actually she wears low-cut green
sexy dress under red coat with big girlish buttons (like a little Pawtucket-
ville girl at afternoon novenas)  her green dress has ribbon collar then
opens below to reveal bosom breastbone which is no longer milkwhite
but weather red. Fact is, further, she wears high-heeled black velvet
pumps and looking close at my old aunt I see she has American peps in
her and her face when lowered over paper has same heartbreaking little
chagrined pout Elly had when I'd find her sometimes sitting doing
nothing ina slant of afternoon sun in our bedroom (Apt. 62) as perhaps

(41)
she foresaw herself as something like this woman in her days of less-
grace there is however something schoolteacherly closed and grave in
her face reading. Ah life.

OH ROADI IN AN ATTEMPT TO IMITATE the taste of a pork dish I _
atein Hartford 1941 when] was passing through on the backofthe truck _
(with my dog), the truck carrying my family s furniture back to Lowell,
and by strange coincidence we stopped at Hartford to eat lunch in a diner
right next door to the Atlantic White Flash where worked with Mike and
Stanfield and Irv Morgan the first thing | hit town but now this
morning, still remembering the wonderful taste of what I guess was
roast pork steamed and kept warm, going on a blueplate dinner with
mashed potatoes, hundreds of great truckdrivers and even some of the
boys from my station devouring it  so me (and movers) tried it and be-
cause it was a crisp day in December and we were on the road it just was _
inexpressibly good to me, thinking then, ignorantly  The best pork-
chop  I ever ate--and in fact Mike was next door at the station and I
talked to him after eating this meal that I haven t forgotten after eleven
years and hesaid What the hell you doing here boy?  and I said  See that
truck out there? we're moving back to Lowell, my family, don t believe  
me?  and  Hyah hyah!  Mike just laughed and in fact came out and
played with my little pup Wacky (Purp  he always called pups) for _
awhile and then the truck rolled on, bearing me sadly back to the scenes
of my boyhoodas I sat watching the moreand more familiar road unwind
from the back of the truck  so I wake up this morning, find cold roast
pork in the icebox, a double chop, and steam it in a pot placed in. a bigger
pot that has water (two inches) that I-boil with a cover over the whole _
works, trying to keep that precious flavor of the pork without frying or _
any kind of fat situation like that and all because I remember that pork-
chop Hartford  41. All you dois head straight for the grave, a face just
covers a skull awhile. Stretch that skull-cover and smile.

TOM CAME TO GET ME in my brightly lit Friday night house with Ma
watching TV, Mrs. Blackstone chatting in and out, thelights along from
bathroom to bedroom as I ablute weekendishly Esquire-ly and whistle
and sing ~ Tom and] in high spirits ~ First complication is Rose wanting
us to visit her at Richmond Hill bar which we do zooming through the
night in big Buick (and she just called with her father the watchmaker
from Russia born sitting right next to the phone in dumbmouth sad easy
chair trance as sexy smallcunt dotter calls boys)   We find the bar, roll-
ing through Octoberclimaxes of leaves falling and Halloween soon and 1
got red October shirt ah me so sad that every year we have to lose our
October!   poor little Rose with her Thirties styleshort dress, pretty legs,

(12)

high click heels, pinched face, perennial cigarette, drinksad eyes at the
baron stool with little pimple this night on chin where you might kiss her
and it would break and I hated tolook at it though on her smooth face now
in retrospect (and it's gone) it memories sexily like a beauty spot kind I
used to see on chins of old movie queens in photos front of theater  -
wondering if it was photo ink   We squeeze into phonebooth two of us
tocall Edand shetells Tom comein and as he does he has to push folding
panel into her cuntbox and she looks him straight in the eye as he pushes
harderand harder so hecanslipin and shesays Comeon, push, push-~ 
and laugh, and air no more air in small booth soon  She has other baby
responsibilities so we go on to New York after exciting preliminary Fri-
day night beers standing (just like in Denver bars of Cody) at stools
freshly laughing and recounting (never I dreamed it was first night of a
five-day binge)   for Friday night to drinking weekenders is like Monday
morning for ambitious clerks. In the ever more exciting big-traffic-all-of-
it-pouring-into-New-York night we zoom down Queens Boulevard for
the hundredth timein our friendship (and as Cody used to do in Hudson)
and talking excited, listening radio Al Collins Purple Grotto (Al is playing
talk-record slow speed so creates terrible monster but interviews it
casually as if nothing) and other things and so bemused I didn t notice
my usual mad notice of New York glittering skyline and we're in town
Tom dropping me off at Wilson's so we won't miss Mac due to meet me
there ten sharp (time also of first round Louis-Marciano fight) and I m
worried Wilson (the meeting place) will be downstairs watching fight
which is exactly what he was doing (with Marian) and where Mac just
arriving from upstate in his car (parked on Park at 57th) comes acciden-
tally, just to catch first round and brew before going up to meet me and
therefore doesn t see sign Wilson left for me and anyway Wilson is
leaving bar because beer too expensive just for fight so they go upstairs
and Marian is sulking because she half wants to go to Westchester on
train but now to solve probably her indecision has perfect opportunity
to blame it on my unasked making a meet with Mac in her house, so that
when at 10:10 1 come running up the stairs like mad all vibrant with the
Friday night excitement that has been buzzing all the way from theIsland
and in fact of course from Tom's garage way out in the sticks in Lynbrook
where his Buick shiny nose waited, in the driveway downstairs reflecting
his shaving lights upstairs as he too sang and dressed and his mother
and family in their richer way were enlivened among all the room lights
of Going Out Friday Night as I ran up the stairs exuding all this joy
which perhaps comes only from living on the Island, on the LAND, and
buzzingin ~and as Tom wheeled away to pick up Ed at Columbus Circle
who was subwaying down from Columbia himself laden with a thousand
dreams of zest because his schoolwork is over and he loves Maria Tom's

(13)
sister and has youthful joys and generally buzzing these days  I run up
stairs smack into Marian sulking in her bathrobe on the sofa (while de-
ciding to give up idea of trains because  now it s too late of course ),
the grim sullen look of the New York-tied maybe and her general recent
retirement from all enthusiasms except martyrism and Wilson him-
self sitting all slicked up (as never) in suit and collar with a patient
martyred look of his own (both of them tight-jawed) because Marian
bugs him and anyway he s bushed from week of drinking and Mc-
Carthy drinking beer, the least surprising one there and now I know why
because he burgeoned enough for ten men within two hours as soon as
he met Josephine and JOHN MACY of all inappropriate, complicated
inopportune people to be there (having called, and being a great popular
witty entertainer of the Wilsons now as Wyndham once was in his less
swish and more boyish way) all four, stolidly sitting, radio much too
loud piping outirritating excited voice  of Bill Corum blow by blow fight  
run in,  Marian! Tom's coming too!" and am met by such a stonewall
of already prepared antagonism and indifference, in fact so much that
Marian made an attempt to grimace her message with eyes and Wilson
didn thelp,somuch that lin my unpreparedness stood like I was shot in

the middle of the room, teetering and quivering as my mind registered  

the psychological atmosphere and also I hadn't said hello to Mac yet
who drove from Poke just for me. Yes, I wanted to go to California and
find my buddy Cody again and myself too.

POUGHKEEPSIE BACKYARDS on a clear, keen, painfully blue late
October day   with thesky looking likeit had been sugar cured, peppered
and cloved and smoked during the night like a ham and was retaining
hintsof glistening moisture in the skin   somewhere in its pigmentation.
 The town of Poke, and the backyards with wash hung out as far as the
eye can see because the lovely simple apple pie wives (like Cody's wife
in rickety Frisco same) with short dresses and sexy bare legs just
naturally have agreed that Monday is Washday so there's a silence in
the mystic rippling clotheslines right now, gardens of silence in the
backyards here and there you see a garage with the door open and
splintered shelves ofoilcansinside a housewifein a housecoat shaking
out her dry mop with dreamy irritation three more of them going by
with groceries and wondering who the fuck is sitting on mad McCarthy's
porch   Thesilent backyards make you think of the men whe are work-
ing with their hands and left things in order during the day, left their
wives to do chores that on an afternoon like this (towels flapping in
unison down the block) is symbolic  the sheets of the night are aired to
Monday rumors it is advertised to the Lord in the sunny heaven that
women live here and the earth is taken care of ~dusk will bring the men

back, slamming along the walls to be let in, rolling home on clattering
rollerskates to occupy (in a blind dream) the houses that sat all day
breathing and waiting for them  little children, meanwhile, who own
thesecret porches, fall adreaming on theswirl of clotheslines, Arctic, sad.

; Far off, like seeing a new nation of monkeys in the trees across the
river (no river, just a rill of gardens) are levels and continents of wash
hung out by treedwellers and seven-foot women: this is an Africa that
you find in the middle of a drowsy American day   Over there, nearer,
they've arrived jiggling all over with curiosity, the little fallen sparrows
~asking themselves questions ~swish, they're gone.

1 REMEMBER CODY, awed telling me, the last time he ever came to
New York, of knock on the door lasting a half hour at Josephine s, his go-
ing down fireescape backlot, landlord who'd bought the damned ground
threw open his window and said  Yes, what is it?  and Cody said  You
wouldn't think a friendly looking fellow like me, and believe me Lam a
friendly nice fellow, would be and even though it s strange for me to say it

_ openly and toa stranger   but I m not a robber  look at me, just look at

me, I assure you. 

It s like when I m looking through Wilson s bookshelf and start
humming a tune while he s arguing with Marian ( Moonglow ).
 What made you think of singing that? 

 I dunno. 

 It'H forever be a mystery to me  

No possible way of avoiding enigmas. Like people in cafeterias smile
when they're arriving and sitting down at the table but when they're
leaving, when in unison their chairs scrape back they pick up their coats
and things with glum faces (all of them the same degree of semi-glum-
ness which is a special glumness that is disappointed that the promise
of the first-arriving smiling moment didn t come out or if it did it died
after a short life)-~and during that short life which has the same blind
unconscious quality as the orgasm, everything is happening to all their
souls   this is the GO  the summation pinnacle possible in human rela-
tionships   lasts a second  the vibratory message is on   yet it's not so
mystic either, it's love and sympathy in a flash. Similarly we who make
the mad night all the way (four-way sex orgies, three-day conversations,
uninterrupted transcontinental drives) have that momentary glumness
that advertises the need for sleep reminds us it is possible to stop all
this more so reminds us that the moment is ungraspable, is already

goneandif wesleep wecan call it up again mixing it with unlimited other
beautiful combinations  shuffle the old file cards of the soul in de-
mented hallucinated sleep  So the people in the cafeteria have that look
but only until their hats and things are picked up, because the glum-

(45)
ness is alsoa signal they send one another, akind of a Goodnight Ladies 
of perhaps interior heart politeness. What kind of friend would grin
openly in the faces of his friends when it's the time for glum coatpicking
and bending toleave? Soit s a sign of   Now we're leaving this table which
had promised so much this is our obsequy to the sad.  The glumness
goes as soon as someone says something and they head for the door 
laughing they fling back echoes to the scene of their human disaster 
they go off down the street in the new air provided by the world.
Ah the mad hearts of all of us.

THE MAN READING THE PAPER before the big green door is like an
Arab in city clothing, felt hat, bow tie, plaid pants, like Aly Khan he has
black hair bulging from the sides under his hat  He sits semi-facing
cafeteria (where us Egyptians wait) under this damn twenty-foot door
that looks like it's going to open behind him and a green monstrous five-
foot hand willcomeout, wraparound his chair and slide him in, the great
door swinging back shut and no one noticing. (And on each side of the
great door is a green pillar!) Inside, that man will be made naked and
humiliated - but actually gladdened he s shaking his head sadly at
the paper   he s moving his foot up and down nervously as he reads  
he's jutting up his lower lip, deep in reading ~ but the way he holds the
paper vertically folded and now bending it over like a little woman to
follow the print you can see his mind's really goofing   and he s waiting
for something else. The big green door holds itself up like a lamb to
sacrifice to the sun at sea dawn over him, and it has wings.

An immense plate glass window in this white cafeteria on a cold
November evening in New York faces the street (Sixth Avenue) but with
inside neon tubular lights reflected in the window and they in turn il-
luminating the Japanese garden walls which are therefore also reflected
and hang in the street with the tubular neons (and with other things
illuminated and reflected such as that enormous twenty-foot green door
with its red and white exit sign reflected near the drapes to the left, a
mirror pillar from deep inside, vaguely the white plumbing and at the top
of things upper right hand and the signs that are low in the window look-
ing out, that say Vegetarian Plate 60 , Fish Cakes with Spaghetti, Bread
and Butter (no price) and are also reflected and hanging but only low on
the sidewalk because also they're practically against it) so that a great
scene of New York at night with cars and cabs and people rushing by and
Amusement Center, Bookstore, Leo s Clothing, Printing, and Ward s
Hamburger and all of it November clear and dark is riddled by these
diaphanous hanging neons, Japanese walls, door, exit signs 

But now let's examine it closer. Riddled and penetrated and ob-
scured and rippled and haunted and of course like kaleidoscope over

(16)

kaleidoscope but above the glittering street are the darkened or brown-
jit windows of Sixth Avenue semi-flophouses and beat doll shops and
blackdust plumbing shops and Waldorf Cafeteria Employment Office
closed, red neons through windows at other end Furthest up in dark
is the focus of this entire human scene: this is a fourth floor unwashed
window with the shade not drawn more than a foot but ever so thin
brown filthy lace or muslin curtain (and now the light went oft!) fail-
ing to hide the shadow of an iron bed. Now that it s gone off the mirror
pillar is suddenly revealed all the way to its entire length because my
attention had been on the actual window and the reflected pillar was
just barely touching the edge of the window and I didn t know it. Most
amazing of all now this reflected mirror pillar hanging in the street is at
the same time reflecting the tubular neon, the real one inside, not the
imaged one outside, and also reflects parts of the wall 1 didn't mention
thatarenot Japanese but checked red and green. There are no more lights
in those windows up there, I'll tell you what happened: some old man
finished his last quart of beer and went to sleep  either that or he was
hungry, wanted tosleep it off instead of spending fifty-five cents for fish-
cakes at Automat oranold whore fell weeping on her bed of darkness  
or they saw me noticing the window four stories and across the street
down themad city night  or now that the light is off they can see me bet-
ter across all these confusions of reflected light (1 know now that para-
noia is the vision of what's happening and psychosis is the hallucinated
vision of what's happening, that paranoia is reality, that paranoia is the
content of things, that paranoia s never satisfied). Other signs, the win-
dow ones, are reflected this way:

(put a mirror to it)
and across this goofiness cars flash by and the asses of pedestrians
hurrying in the cold flash by, when it s yellow cabs the flash is brilliant
yellow streak, when people the flash is memoried and human (a hand,
a bag, a burden, a coat, a package of canvases, a dull, above it the float-
ing white faces)  When it's a car the flash is dark and shiny and staring
into it for all signs of flashes sometimes you only see soft clicking on-
coming andoutgoing of glow from neon lights intertwined in the street  
and the white line in the middle of Sixth Avenue, and just the barest
indication of a piece of litter in the gutter across the street unless just the
gutter s reminder, without looking but just absorbing as you stare the
people pass and you know what they are (two Texans! I knew it! and two

(17)
Negroes! I knew it!)a beat gray coupe flashed through looking like som

glass window that I ve been staring at for half an hour, peeking through
an area of six inches between the drapes and the window is a sidewall
mirror which is reflecting everything that s happening to the right of me
up the street, in fact to places I can t even see, so that while staring into
my  flasher  I suddenly saw a cab coming out of the corner of my eye
anditjust never arrived, just disappeared  it was coming from the right
inactuality, in reflection from the left, and 1 had been watching the flash
of actual rightward going cars and cabs   In that six-inch area also are_
the people, observing thesamelaws of movementand reflection but from
not so great a distance because they are closer to the plate glass, specifi-
cally closer to the miraculous mirror, and aren't outflung in the road.
appearing from far off. While observing this  flasher  a car came and
parked in it, that is, a very shiny new fender is seen (obscuring, for in-
stance, the white line in middle of road) and in that fender that's round
those crazy little images of things and light seen on round shinies (like _
when your nose hugens as you look closer) those little images but too
small for me to observe in detail from a distance are playing  they re
playing only because a red neon is flashing and every time it s on I see
moreof them than otherwise~ and actually the main neon crazy image |
is playing on the silver rim of a headlamp of an Oldsmobile 88 (as I look
and see now) as it flashes on and off red, and I hear above the clatter and
sleepiness of cafeteria dishes (and swish of revolving door with flapping
rubbers) and voices moaning, I hear above this the faint klaxons and
moving rushes of the city and I have my great immortal metropolitan in-
the-city feeling that I first dug (and all of us) as an infant . . . smack in
the heart of shiny glitters.

ROAMING THOSE SUBWAYS I see a Negro cat wearing an ordinary: |

gray felt hat but a deep blue, or purplish shirt with white shiny pearl-_
type buttons a gray sharkskin suit jacket over it but brown pants, 4
black shoes, deep blue ordinary one-stripe socks and gabardine topper  
short and beat, with edgebottoms rain-raveled  carrying brown paper _
bag  his face (he s sleeping) is big powerful fighter s sullen thicklipped  
(thick Afric lip) but strangely pudgy sweet face -~dark brownskin  his
big hands hang, his fingernails are pink (not white) and are soiled from
a laboring job  Looks like Joe Louis only a Joe Louis who has known
nothing but the freezing cold Harlem winter mornings when old black-
bumbs infinitely beater than ald Cody Pomeray of wino Denver go by

(18)

with wool caps pulled over their ears with no prospects for the future
whatever except below zero filthy snows   His look is wild, frightened,
almost tearful as he wakes from a nap and looks across aisle at redfaced
white man in glasses and gray clothes with a big red ruby on his finger,
as if that man wanted to kill him especially . . . (in fact man has eyes
closed andchews gum). Now cat has seen me and looks at me with a kind
of dawning simple interest but falls right back to sleep (people have
watched him before).

This cat is coming from a job in Queens where undoubtedly there is
awirefenceand hecarries some kind of mop and goes about bareheaded.
Now his big Harlem hat is on again (did I say ordinary? It has that wild
level-swooping Harlem sharpness worked in, an Eastern hat, thousands
of cats in the street). He makes me think too of that strange Negro gurgle
or burbiein the voice that goes with the strangely humble clownish posi-
tion of the American Negro and which he himself needs and wants be-
cause of a primarily meek Myshkin-like saintliness mixed with the
primitive anger in their blood. When he left he walk-waddled out, from
sideto side, clicking, lazy, half asleep,  What you doin? what you doin? 
it,and he, seemed to say tome   Damn, nowhe gone, he gone, ! love him.

But now let's examine these American fools who want to be big
burpers and ride in the subway with starched white collars (Oh G. J.,
yourabyss?) and  business  clothes and yet by God they laugh and strain
eagerly to their friends just like happy Codys, Leos, Charley Bissonnettes
of time~  this one s a small businessman, actually a good guy I can tell
by his pleading laugh  the kind that chokes and says  Oh yes say it
again, I loved you that time!  And woe! woe! upon me, now I see he's a
cripple left foot-~-and his face is the face now of a serious frowning
eager invalid maybe like the face of that rollerboard monster on Larimer
Street whomust have turned it hugeand eager from his bottoms when he
saw him, young Cody, come ball-bouncing down the street from school
inaslant of tragic lost afternoons long departed from the memory of love,
whichis thesecret of America ~lost too, this subway invalid, in the folds
of his own thick bustling manlike neck muscles  carrying a paper file
envelope  chatting with tall younger fellow in glasses whom he admires
and to whom he leans of course with that love of older man for younger
man and especially of sick man for healthy dumbman everywhere.

CLOSER TO HOME, IN JAMAICA, still wandering, a lovely bakery
window: cherry pie with little round hole in the middle to show glazed
cherries  same with all crust pies, including mince, apple fruit cakes
with cherries, nuts, glazed pineapple sitting in erect paper cups~
wonderful custard pies with their golden moons~-powdered lemon-
filling layer cakes  little extraspecial cookies two-toned also two-

(19)
toned chocolate icings on round beautiful chocolate cakes with sprink-
lings of brown crumbs around bottom edges and lovely raveled arrange-

ments in icing itself done with baker's trowels   Those fat scrumptious E

apple-pineapple cakes that look like bigger editions of Automat-cakes,
lumpy icing with a glaze-- Everybody's watching  Wild raggedy
coconut cakes with a cherry in the middle . . . like wild white hair.

The traceries of a tree against the gray rainy dusk 

It gave me a shudder of joy to see a cake with pink icing on top all |

raveled; with aredcherry in the middle, thesides around all covered with
chocolate chip!

But across the street a bleak rectory. On the lawn in front are two
twenty-foot spruce trees the building is that peculiarly pale orange
brick, color of puke, cat's puke  done up English style, or Saxon, with
fort ramparts over the door, the oaken door but pale brownoaken not dark
with three little glazed windows on top for decoration and one in middle
for the purpose of looking to see who's coming in -on each side of gray
concrete frame to all this with the carved oldprint word Rectory are
jolly Charles Dickens English lamps then two little narrow slit win-
dows about a foot wide, four foot down at base of this bunched en-
trance is cellar-window behind concrete protective curb of some kind
(nameless, crazy, like the Christmas tree shrubberies in front of subur-

separate this, elevate, or emphasize its elevation from sidewalk and
something never used or understood by anybody except those incurable
sitters like me and Cody)

that a gray concrete cross that looks like the stanchions you see around
war memorials in parks in the South and like crosses on cemetery main

offices. Warm rich orangelights burn in rectory at dusk. This is certainly
nothing like Proust's Combray Cathedral, where the stone moved in
eccentric waves, the cathedral itself a great refractor of light from

 outside    CF$S$H$HSSSESS

THE POOR LONELY OLD LADIES OF LOWELL who come out of
thefive-and-ten with their umbrellas open for the rain but look so scared
and in genuine distress not the distress of secretly smiling maids in the
rain who havegood legs to hop around, the old ladies have piano legs and
have to waddle to their where-to   and talking about their daughters any-
way in the middle of their distress.

coat wholumbers along, his lips loosened in some sullen thought and as
though it wasn't raining in his huge dry soul  

The fat old lady incredible-burdened notonly with umbrellas and rain
cape but underneath bulging pregnantly with hidden protected packages
that stick so far out she has trouble avoiding bumping people on side-
walk and when she gets in the bus it will create a major problem for the
poor people who are now, in their own parts of the city headed for the
bus, unsuspecting of this ~

The sharp little rich Jewish lady in a fur coat who lofts an umbrella

tion peasant woman of swank apartments with a hairy husband Aaron
whodeals in high finance with the gravity and hirsute slowness ofan ape,
she s headed home with a package and the rain like other things does not
distress her 

The Irish gentleman all bundled tightly in a dark greenslick raincoat,
collar up, tight at his raveled chin, hat, no umbrella, a Httle anxious as
he proceeds somewhat slowly to his objective and lost in thought of his
job or wife or by God anything including feelings of homosexual deteri-
oration or that Communists are secretly controlling his life at this very
moment by thought-waves from a machine projecting from a submarine
five miles offshore, maybe a teletype operator at U.P., thinking this as
hegoes down Sixth Avenue the name of which was changed to Avenue of
the Americas some years ago to his complete disgust, going along sur-
rounded by this entire night of dark rain in this moment of time that he
occupies with a white scared sidelook at something on the bottom of the
sidewalk (which isn't me) 

The young darkhaired plump pimply guy of thirty in a blue cloth
jacket, from Brooklyn, who spends Sunday afternoons reading funnies

awkwardness and womanly Gea-like distress and ecstatic agony that
they suffer in pinecone rows beneath the cobwebby moons of New
Hampshire or even (name it) Minnesota and so are really doomed as

they tell this shameful story without a true sense of forest sistership
anyway in a nonexistent goddamn New York.

As far as young women are concerned I can t look at them unless I
tear off their clothes one by one including this last girl (with her Ma)
wearing a green bandana and cute little face and long newlook coat, and
low heels, walks throwing her thighs loosely as though floppy and not
as much control as her youth would indicate, and the big coat hides her
figure lines but I figure her cunt is sweet, you get to it via white lace
panties, andshe be fine. This is almost all 1 can say about almost all girls
and only further refinement is their cunts and will do.

FOLLOWING LEE KONITZ the famous alto jazzman down the street
and don't even know what for  saw him first in that bar on the north-
east corner of 49th and Sixth Avenue which is in a real old building that
nobody ever notices because it forms the pebble at the hem of the shoe
of the immense tall man which is the RCA Building   | noticed it only
theother day while standing in front of Howard Johnson's eating a cone,
or rather it was too crowded for me to get a cone and'I was just standing
there and I was thinking  New York is so immense that it would make
no difference to anybody's ass if this building exists and is old  ~Lee,
who wouldn t talk to me even if he knew me, was in the bar (from which
I've made many phonecalls) waiting with big eyes for his friend to show
upand sol waitedoncorner to think and soon I saw Lee coming out with
his friend who'd arrived and it was Arnold Fishkin the Tristano bass-
player  two little Jewish gazotsky fellows they were really as they cut
across the street and Konitz in that manner that was forceful and I said
to myself  He can take care of himself even though he goofs and does
 Aprilin Paris  from inside out as if the tune was the room he lived in and
was going out at midnight with his coat on"  ~(but I haven't heard him
for weeks and weeks)  Both of them real small among the crowds, Fish-
kin is five-foot-three or such and Konitz five-six or such  cutting along
so! follow, and they turn west at 48th, I go across the street, temporarily
bemused first by a sign fora large furnished room with cooking privileges
and bath in a beat sort of hidden tenement smack in the cunt of midtown
but how can I live there or even be like Lee Konitz cutting around the
world of men and women when my father told me to take care of my
mother on his deathbed. (these my thoughts) and where d you think
they go but Manny's the music store of hipsters and Symphony Sid but
which however at this moment (and strangely connected with the
feeling | had had while waiting for Konitz looking over big buildings to
see Atlantic clouds blowing in from sea and realizing sea is bigger even
than New York and that's where I oughta be) is filled with a whole crew
of sailors apparently in the store to buy equipment for a big whaling
oompapa Navy band! And Konitz goes completely unrecognized by them
although the Danny Richman-like owners know Lee so well they don t
say to him, as I would,  Where you playing now, great genius?  they

(23)
say  When you leaving?  knowing already of his road plana  Lee buys
reeds or such in a box almost but not quite big enough for an alto (and
already packed and waiting for him) and then he and Fishkin cut around
the corner (as I follow through a sea of crowds) to a mysterious marble
lobby of big office buildings and cut right upstairs on foot and in fact a
whole bunch of hip looking guys are coming to do same {avoiding eleva-
tors) and I study board to find out big deal on second floor or third

Alittle boy in red woodsman shirt stoops to drink water at the dry con-
crete fountain a flag whips through the bare bleak branches  salmon
is the color of parts of the sky  the children in the swings kick their feet
in air, mothers say Wheee a trash wirebasket is half full of dry, dry
leaves  a pool of last night's rain lies in the gravel; tonight it will be cold,
clear, winter coming and who will haunt the deserted park then?

IN FALL 1980. when I was so much on weed, three bombs a day, thinking
about unhappiness all the time I one night really carefully and high
listened to George Handy s  The Blues  (Vicki had his picture up on
wall with mine and Charlie Parker's, the mind, the hand, and me the
heart she said) but to really drift and I found it a big mocking sound and
specifically the joy of the bop middle with Herby Steward is rejected for
this modern or rather sadomasochistic modernity, on T I was able to see
that Handy was sacrificingjoy which existed naturally in his heartfor the
glooms and despairs and great disappointed deaths, the deadly loss of

(24)

ego, the last acknowledgement of self  the music seemed to say  There
arestill a few things that you can cling to and this I supposed you should
be soothed about  ha ha but you won't even get that though there's
joy in our souls (bop interlude) we are nothing but shits and we'll ali die
and eat shit in graves andare dying now.  Pretty powerful talk!

MORE AND MORE I THOUGHT OF CODY, ! wanted to say to him  All
ofasudden I remember a sunset when my father was driving me and his
buddy Old Mike Fortier and I think young Mike my buddy was there too,
inthis old  34 Plymouth, to Nashua, N.H. to meet a circus man they were
playing poker with, maybe it was W. C. Fields!, in the summertime, my
father wearing a strawhat that with certain types of faces, say Jimmy
Foxx s has gone completely out of American life, me noticing and never
to forget againa certain house by the side of the road, a farmer's house or
more exactly the house of a callous-fingered character of the woods like
you must have in the West who always has two, three cords of wood

~ gtacked in his yard and maybe drives into town Saturday nights in his

Essex that he uses the back of for loads of wood to buy the Sunday
funnies, that kind of hodgepodge made-by-himself house and my
thoughts ran along just about what I m saying now eighteen years later;
dreaming this, and also on the big inclusive event of the sinking sun,
especially as it showed slanting and golden and all that in the grass,
when suddenly Old Mike lit his pipe and puffed and this unforgettable
inexpressively rich smell pervaded the car as they went right on talking:
asmell that! remembered just tonightagain, nothing leas than a big man
poking pudgy fingers at the bowl of his pipe on an ordinary afternoon in
1933 when probably you, at seven or six, were doing any one of the in-
numerable visions I haveof youin Denver atall ages  asmell that wasn't
so much a certain tobacco but arose like a genie from the fact that Old
Mike had to do with its inception. The smell was Mike himself, my
buddy's father, the big favorite of a mad gang my father had (all of them
with wives, children, houses, just like you), who used to sneak up on one
another, I remember sitting in the parlor listening to the old pre-Basil-
Rathbone Sherlock Holmes on the radio with my father and sis and
suddenly in kitchen I see a man creeping up like an Indian with twelve
people creeping behind him from the kitchen door and it's a surprise
party which rocks house (small rose-covered cottage, actually and no
shit, next to a rickety grocery store, on West Street Lowell) till dawn,
Big Mike was theleading maniac of the gang or that is at least the biggest
most hearty swearer, shocked even the screeching ladies of this exclu-
sive French-Canadian raucous madclub while another madcap (Mon-

-. gtte) was actually the chief Indian creeper and screamer, I think in fact

put on women's clothes and screamed like Finistra, but anyway at the
(25)
same time Old Mike was alsothe most grave, sober, quiet and meditative
oneatother times, and was smoking his pipe thus when the memory was
instilled in me by the same forces eighteen years ago which now drive
me obsessively to remember. When a man puffs a pipe his eyes bulge
over the smoking bow! into space, he seems to have sinus trouble and
all such big adult wreckages and profound architectural failings that
on the other hand couldn't possibly exist if the man wasn t a pillar of
strength and didn t have huge belly to stand it; I had seen Mr. Fortier
staring at me over his pipe with the same bulging eyes when I semi-
tiptoed past his  den  in the Fortier house, always fearful of disturbing.
the privacy of such an enormous father, he had ten kids, a three-hundred-
pound wife and believe this: a sixteen-room house with a few old lady
lodgers far off in the bowels somewhere, a house, with concomitant
cellar, so vast, so unbelievable that I since dream of it as a boat floating
to Boston and Greenland on a canal, not a rich house or manse or any-
thing just an old New England monstrosity he'd bought for say ten
thousand dollars smack in the middle of the wild Canuck tenements of
Salem Street, always fearful that he would see me pass and then I'd have
to say something which never came out without an effort so agonizing
and personal to something lost in me that I d go away grabbing my
sweater and cursing myself... but now he was sitting beside me,
fatherly, I hadno cause to be scared though as I say I always felt he liked
myold man but not me, that something separated me from those qualities
in my old man that made him love the name Duluoz, and that  some-
thing  was lost to me forever, I'd never get it back even to examine it,
and in fact I realized it was all a big paranoia of mine (even then you
see!). Oh Lord have pity on our souls and the pipesmoke suddenly
became the fulfillment of the fact that this tremendous father was and
had been all along accepting me, thus, following the events of yes 
terday.. . the loneliness . . . the (as Proust says God bless him)  inex-

pressibly delicious  sensation of this memory for as memories are

older they re like wine rarer, till if you find a real old memory, one of
infancy, not an established often tasted one but a brand new onel,
it would taste better than the Napoleon brandy Stendhal himself must
have stared at ... while shaving in front of those Napoleonic can-
nons.... 

SUBURBAN CITY  FOOD SHOP  of which there is none bleaker than.
this one in the gloomy Jamaica night  the MERIT Food Shop, written
in green neon (greon) in the window, MERIT is, and Food Shop in or-
ange~ now why?  Youpick up your ticket cafeteria style coming in, the.
thing rolls and rings. The floor is all shades of brown and yellow  peb-
bled" marble with little thin metal lines separating various sections;

(26)

covered with dirty napkins (from metal boxes on counter), cigarette
packs, clusters of sawdust tracked from behind counter   Two waitress-
typegirls who just came in of course brighten it up and make me think of
Hartford though I look mad with beard, shirts  What's so bleak 
Jamaica itself; secondly the cold sad Sunday midnight; nobody knows
anybody else, not even as in 23rd Street Rikers, suburban cities are
centers of vast residential districts so big out-of-town people couldn't
conceive- people in here live miles and miles apart, are going through
Jamaica in the transportation system only  The coffee is given to you
intact with cream, always too much cream  Further dark faced types
in topcoats suddenly begin talking about Columbia game with counter-
man (as though they were fraternity presidents with golden hair) 

Inconceivably quiet switchmen from Long Island Railroad (L.LR.R.) 
Outside all I can see of the night is a green neon clock that says WATCH
HOSPITAL around the time which is in red   A tall usher-like thin boy
came in for coffee and hamburger~ going home now theater's closed
(andcan t even cook one in his own kitchen), going home along cold sub-
urban street with wind and dry leaves and dark  

This place is bleaker than any Rikers and of course any lunchcart
because there s nothing to define it with  how can I describe this table
top I 'mon, this marble plytex with metal rim?

Ah fuckit, I'l go home and think in the dark.

The first desk on Phoebe Avenue first brown desk was placed
against the wall in the room that served as the dining room only when

* wehad company  the furniture still had chalkmarks under made by me

and Nin and Gerard  The brown, in fact mahogany darkness of this
my first study~ and this first desk  window was on left, lace, facing
Mrs. Quinn  

Whether her cherry trees were in bloom or not it was brown in this
room   when my father had rheumatism in it the sheets of his sickbed
made it gray   now this is an  inexpressibly delicious  old memory like
old port  nothing in California matches it. I rolled my glassies for the
first time on the jagged wood of the desk  it was when I got idea for rac-
ing, they meandered a race under my eyes   it was a gray day  the whole
idea of the Turf must have come to me like (as just now and not since
1948) that so-seldom experience of seeing my whole life s richness
swimming in a palpable mothlike cloud, a cloud 1 can really see and
which I think is elfin and due really to my Celtic blood -~coming only in
moments of complete inspiration. . . . In my life I number them proba-
bly below five at least on this level  

Followed by those first strips of race results, the green ones ~the
Turf was inexpressibly connected with masturbation as Haunted
Memories like this must be.

ST. PATRICK S CATHEDRAL: most striking of the windows and I didn t -
expect strikingness at this late hour  is at upper front left  a lonely icy

congealed blue with streaks of hot pink   little blue holes  painted with
an immeasurable blue ink, noir comme bleu, black like blue, I was going
to say three Apostles but there are only two, third slot is not figure, is
three one-third-size endisced figures almost like holes in skating ice 
but with a winter swamp water full of mill dyes and midnight no sky
has had thecolorof this glass, and I know skies  all other windows here
now dimming except this  It faces East, must be amazing tomorrow
morning  faces East like my poor hospital window  Lord, I scribbled
hymns to you--the other windows grow rich, brown, dark, secret, get
better with age of light like wine with age of Time  The halo round the
head of first figure remains bright and shining in the now general mid-
night blue of the window  halo of second figure is more humble this

window is secreted away and almost has samecolor as windows at half- 7
way point turningpoint of stairs in old Victorian homes -concealed =

too  Only now | begin to notice the green  ~ The similar triple window
behind and abovealtar is now gone into the night   but not here. St. Jean
Baptiste is smaller than this but I think more holy because of Canadians 
Sunday morning at 5:30 like Marie Louise  Now the window darkens
to match the great transformations without, refracting them inward to
these kneelers, who can't stand ordinary glare of life in their musty
meditations and guilty anxieties  Peoplecometochurch for guilt now  
Ah, a French insurance salesman over there (from Centralville)  from
Forest Hills vraiment  an older Pat O'Brien in dark almost priestlike
suit to my left ~chutches prayer book devoutly, closes eyes with match-
ing fervor--O huge sorrow!

Thealtar of St. Joseph at my right a symphony in brown  his brown
vestments with the traditional waist cord, the flickering brown candle
racks ~~ the brown confessional in back in its swarming nameless church
shadows where old men whisper laryngitisly in your ear, with a rich
wine, portwine red velvet drape and somewhere a priest is eating
grapes  A curious young woman in a muskrat fur coat is hanging
around there lighting candles  What's her truck with St. Joseph?  he
who now with demure plaster countenance, holding the insubstantial
child with feet and face too small and body too doll like, presses cheek
against the painted curls, supports in midair lightly against his brown
breast the Son, with unstraining but rather greeting hand, downward
looking into candles, agony, the foot of the world, all the angels and
calendars and spirey altars behind him, eyes lowered to a mystery he
himself wasn t hipped to yet he'll go along in the belief that poor St.
Joseph was clay to the hand of God (statue), a humble self-admitting
truthful Saint  with none of the vain freneticisms of Francis, a Saint

(28)

without glory, guilt, accomplishment or charm  a self-effacing grave
and demure ghost in the Arcades of Christendom  he who knew the
desert stars, and spat with the Wise Men in back of the barn--arranger
of the manger, old hobo saint of haylofts and camel trails--Old lady
in black coat and gray hair(Ma TanteJustine)socks thenecessary action,
the coin, into the candlelight concession and Joseph acknowledges with
that ungraspable imperceptible sigh of statues  
Now my holy blue window, the one like the window at 94-21 that

made me so often think there was a weird blue light in the railyards
which could only beseen from halfway down the hall stairs when actual-
ly it, the window, was only taking the ordinary corner streetlamp which
was in line with railyards and giving it inky blue hues like that apoca-
lyptic-end-of-the-world blue light, the light of subterranean stars, we've
all seen in tunnels especially subway tunnels ~ that window, as sudden-
ly now I hear the chorus of prayers in a rickety mumble repeating the
moans of an accredited adjuror either upstairs or so far up front that it's
inconceivable to my senses like some of the distances in the West all
I see is five spaced ordinary ladies, only two of them side by side, and it
can t be them make this ghostly prayer   It s a novena in the innards of
thechurch itself, it is locked in the stone and released each night at this
time by the wizardly prayers of some old hooknosed ribbon clerk who
acts like a divining rod withal to draw the innate sound out of the
churchy-twisted Chicago stone (1 have just noticed that the marble
squares in the floor are also separated by metal rims like in the MERIT
Food Shop last night)   The novena hushkehush sounds like this: agony
in the hands, fakery, fear of moaning, so a general communal drone that
takes careof the moan-sound when itrises en masse in these stone arches
that were made and shaped to transform irritable mumbles into long-
faced groans   Far off across the sea of seats and the continent of the
altar, among Gothic holes and openings, I seea parade of hand claspers

and one flitting wispy ravenclad boy priest who wheels to kneel and
coughs politely There, too, I see flickers like the fires of Hannibal s
camp across the plains of Rome This window is now gone dead with

the night, woe unto the last halo, it didn't seem possible  The leading

novena voice is like a woman s  can it be? Before me kneeling is a hum-

ble little woman in a black cloth coat and cheap fur collar, with black

beret, ordinary hair, praying like the ladies, the unobtrusive unshowing-

off ladies of Lowell especially the French ones who live above the Royal

Theater and wait for their husbands to come home Saturday night from

Manchester, from over yonder over the gray woods where the crow

caws 

Many years ago in a church just like this but smaller, holier, more

venerated by hearts, [came with hundreds of little death-conscious boys

(29)
of St. Joseph Parochial School (church always filled us with the knowl-
edge of the gloom and horror of funerals even if we had learned to recon-
cile ourselves to the shame and sadness of confession, confirmation
exercises, what all)  Wecircled in orderly terror and also boredom be-
neath the greatarches that weren't high likethis yet seem the same height
and from which depended the longest lamp chain of my experience 
there are some actually that long here but only unobtrusive at sides and
supporting unimportant side lamps shaped unimpressively like
circular breadboxes with Jap lantern sides and eight-dise bottoms shin-
ing (fragrant glimmer) - The one at St. Jean was the main lamp of the
entire church, an immense chandelier of the house of God greater than
chandelier in anybody's including City Hall house Always this kind of
girlin church: unbearably pretty, unbearably neat, carrying unbearably
crisp and crinkling package, unbearably stylish and in gay but not wild
colors ~ this one white silk kerchief well flowed and green coat and un-
bearably sharpclean high heels  but lalways think:  You'retoo unbear--
able for anything   the least or most of which is love or the house of the
real dying God Where do you go, doll of the bathtub? to Purgatory to

clean up some more to hell to burn neatly~to heaven for snow to -

church to add fresh snow to the snow of your soul?  Have you sinned?
canit be? Is the white snow of church respectability what you come for? 
But this is wasteful speculation   Now in Mexico, on San Juan Letran, I
know churches wherelittle barefooted girls in rags kneel in dust andin
Lowell, though, you'll see crispy-clean in church, she s everywhere, I
don t know what she's up to, who she's trying to drive away (me I
guess)  speculation  

Slam! the great slam of a pew box in echoey church it sounds like
thesad gun of eternity being fired in the name of mortal imperfection a
vicious priest performs the rite to see effects he mocks those who're
afraidto try slamming  and vanishes onshroudy feet to tear the chicken
at rectory nappes with a spot-splash of wine and a joke about the great
syphilitic Pope who was squeezed inte his coffin but never said a word
against the church  An American flag and a nameless crazy Steinberg
flag hang above  out front, Easter Day 1950, I covered parade with Sara
and United Press  My life O vast beginning pillars of the knee-rest's
base O marble bottoms of stony heaven  Here in St. Patrick's they
have rubber mats for knees, no tortured wood. A fag television dancer in
white turtleneck and sport jacket swishes down the aisle  But this re-
minds me, all these women indiscriminately scattered in a church at
evening, of Lowell and the way they've swallowed priest's cock in that
humility of theirs that commands me to desist and know the  fear of
God  and they love funerals, I don t; they love wax, love musty indoors
and innards of bloody altars  

(30)

The men in here are horses  asses - And now finally the window is so
out that the bottom glass reflects brownly the lights that just came on
for an imminent service.

These glass windows refract NIGHT toofor now! see nothing but the
rich dim recollections of what at dusk was a Rembrandt barrel of ale in
a Dublin saloon when Joyce was young, the hint so vague it's like people
in a dark room wearing phosphorescent rims and all involved in some
drama so tragic that the light of day can t shine on it  only the inward
light of night  A holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead so
that they may be removed from sin" from Maccabees. The priest
speaking: now he quotes MacArthur Old Soldier crap  mixing theo-
logical verities with today's headlines, blah, blah, Inow goout, tired, into
my own thoughts and have no place to go but find my road.

HIPSTER, SOUP, didn t get any bread because he s so habitually
thincan t absorb it~ just soup  tall, thin, dark long hair almost bun in
back coolly stirs soup, tries it for heat, casts scornful glance around,
starts  still blowing   wearing (now really deep in eating, all he needs
is little soup) a sharp-cut lapel suit with tieless yellow sport shirt 
hornrim glasses, mustache  his curiosity is thinly veiled in a sophisti-
cated glare, done side-eyed y see  A guy sat opposite him, he glances
coldly into his face, other ain t looking so studies him a little longer cold-
ly table manners flawless  now he sinterested in guys open paper up-
side down on table   looks quickly over a shoulder pad to notice sources
of noiseand voices   wipes himself with napkin using both hands dainti-
ly now lights his cigarette, as he came in he threw the crumpled pack
(disdainfuily) on the table before taking big hipster winter blue coat
off now he s finished, just came in to eat, warm up some, puts it on,
goes   reaching in pants pockets in that nameless gesture men have in
topcoats when they so reach  glossy hair to Eighth Avenue.

Now exactly in his place without knowing who was there before, the
poor lost history of it, sits a pretty brunette with violet eyes and a
flowing purple drapecoat  takes it off like stripteaster, hangs it on hook
(back toit) and starts eating with pathetic delicate hunger her hot plate 
deep in thought whileshechews  wearing cute little white collar draped
over black material and three pendants, pearls; lovely mouth; she just
blew her nose daintily with a napkin; has private personal sad manners,
at least externally, by which she makes her own formal existence known
to herself as well as polite social cafeteria watchers she s imagining,
otherwise why the act though it is genuine. She took a bite off the fork
and THEN and how she'd blow! she licked the side of it in a slight furtive
movement of pleasure, her eyes darting up to see if anybody noticed this
~as her hunger is appeased she grows less interested in outward man-

(31)
ners, eats more rapidly, has sadder more personal bemusements with
herself over thegeneral rim and consciousness of her cunt which is in her
lap as she sits 

She breaks my heart just like X. and all my women have broke my
heart (just by looking at her) that s why women are impractical for
me-  Now,as I say these great grave things, she turns and watches a Na-
val officer leaving with open flirtatious interest but he didn t acknowl-
edge, just flapped his coat like Annapolis or a shroud and left, and she
watched anyway as if for the benefit of any girls watching her dig a man,
as if she was in the WACS, or made little jokes about the shortage of
 available  men when all thetime the good men like me peek at their souls
like this unnoticed ha ha- - An ugly woman is sitting opposite her; my
girlis bored, looks away, abstractly primps her hair  Her nose has that
interesting littlecurvedness that emphasizes the plump point pearshape
of her cheeks and general Indian melancholy or Semitic womanliness  
her fingers are long, long and extremely thin and breakable and I bet
cold  warm heart no doubt about it Now, finished, she hangs to look
around, tosses her head to see, coughs, feels her own chin, is bemused
as if on acock and sameas in sun doing wash  with that little ravenous
birdy attention to things, to special female-comprehension things  yet

_allofa sudden she's drowned in sorrow looking at mirror, at herself and
also just into space but snaps, darts around the head to see people,
couples, women and men (always interested exclusively in the man's
bearing with big coat and proudness at the wintry entrance and the wom-
an s acceptance of this and flaunt of it at cafeteria with birdy dignities
and knowledges and primps of her own while man dreams in his own
dream of himself with a self-satisfied smile) and further she s aware
at this very momentof thesheenof the ebony-latex tabletop with its innu-
merable microscopic scratches but she s really thinking of something
I'll never know, since I was in the Cathedral while what she's thinking
about probably took place. She lingers a long time fora girl  waiting?  
cold? ~sad, lonely?  I can t help her, I'm doomed to these universal
watchfulnesses  and a whore or two  With her head down inexpress-
ible purity shows in her face, like a young Princess Margaret Rose, and
beauty, slant-eyed young girl beauty with freshness of the cheeks and
upward-sending rosy-glow lips  she's reading a library book! and sigh-
ing!  a freshness that comes from her lips being chastely compressed
andis aura d from the tendernesses of her neck just beneath the ear from
the fragile white breakable susceptible cool brow which will never know
wild sweats, just cool beads of joy  as she reads she fondles the creases
thatrun from hernose to her moutheach side with doubly applied finger-
tips and is really digging her own face and beauty as much as I turns
the bookpages with small finger, so long, ridiculously far out the book

(32)

is a Modern Library!   therefore she s probably no dumb little book-of-
the-monther typist but maybe a hip young intellectual girl from Brook-
lyn waiting for Terry Gibbs to pick her up and take her to Birdland. She'd
melt for me in two minutes, I can tell by looking at her. Big horrible mid-
dleaged Jewish couple sitting now with her like invading Ammonites.
Now she goes   beautifully, with simplicity. It no longer makes me cry
and die and tear myself to see her go because everything goes away from
me like that now   girls, visions, anything, just in the same way and for-
ever and | accept lostness forever.
Everything belongs to me because I am poor.

1 HAVE REVES, abed on a third-story tenement porch and any moment
I can turn over, ruin the balance of the corrupted porch and fall down
with the works or I can turn over and fall out of bed through the rickety
railing   This porch kills me  it s like Moody Street above Textile Lunch
porch  The tenement, O woe, is in middle of woods with Philippine
wars and also  Dracut"  Mike and Jeannette and Rita mostly are
there  [amill, thus bed, as in Margaret Cole ill-on-porch-but-first-story
dream  these woods are green and belong to that up-and-down hilly
rickety village by the lakes which associates with the Horace Mann hill
and the S.S. Dorchester at foot of it.

And day before an incredibly exciting perfect dream I was told to
find my way back to the Kingsbridge Hospital started by way (out of
same spectral Pawtucketville two weeks ago sprouted Lowell-center
skyscrapers) of Mt. Vernon or Crawford Street, on hill part that leads to
pines of  North Lowell  like  and Road became one of these brand new
oiled sand roads out by places, hills where I did some dream-sliding and
actual three-year-old real-life-rolling on wheels  through such woods,
afew  American  cars going by, smack leading into the Hospital, where
the walls, the doors (the same place three weeks ago bombarded by
artilleries) and same place where those patients joked with me in a big
room with all complicated jokes and wheelchairs, whirlpool baths (and

~ that artillery dream, we started at hospital but moved up to the front,

to night, MacArthur, boom, enemy land and town, but made our way
back), This  Gardner  sand road goes among woods where (near sand-
bank) my Maand I once moved to tenement and similar to Mike's rickety
porch one among woods where also are hills that begin in Blood-
worth's Highlands and go all the way to immense hills of Gardiner,
Maine via sunsets and Norths that go even further to Greenland of
pumps, via canals, the canal being that which Fortiers and us in Ger-

  shom but also Salem house floated to Boston, a spectral canal, far from

dull, and in any case big house like Lowell high school basement, Salem
basement, Paramount theater apartments (on Times Square) so vast

(33)
and sunny and the one big high-ceiling rich glassy-on-the-floor huge one-
man room Cody had to do with in last night's dream before our rendez-
vous with the sensualists who had girls, weed, and that Mexico apart-
ment (Medellin) tablecloth (that fleecy soft bed and soft table, what a
Joy to recall it! damn!  ).

This Philippine wood round Mike's house is the one in the bigyard
Horace Mann dream and is just like Hospital grounds, pale green, after-
noon green (Ah that relaxin at Kingsbridge! talk about your Touros and
Camarillos), the dream of the westbank Mike-first Hudson River home-
stead, the trees of Versailles  in which Duke Gringas was and later real
infantry movements and one time a jungle clearing with snipers and
straw the Philippine, or Mike woods are | think different level than
Chet Vaska Lakeview also Central City North woods and maybe even
rolling hills of loway with cops and gun and connected to another part
of the Hudson westbank in redbrick  Hospital whirlpool jokes like the
cruel needle jests of sadistic docs in Japan war and in fact in Japan itself
when I saw that Jap boy at dark dusk in cold London hat O the vast
arcades of that London! with my father! and Liverpool gang nights.
Tony Bero was with Duke Gringas.

The sensualists were Richman and that Glennon guy | lived near
where the mattress fires took place, 40th Street behind big high Times
Square where I always find my show on a glittering apple-pie corner,
show s inside and is always Brooklyn one (with high terrible balcony}
that I reach via Lynn-like brownbrick leaving behind sad Nashua sor-

rows where my father is either onelegged or is Louise himself ina trun- _

cated house and the Nashusislike Asbury Park and the towns of Nin and

Paul in the South (because of one Main Street) where recently I had an  

affair with a girl and handled a rake on bonfire night  that country goes

back via Vaska northwoods and King and jagged Colorado namelessly
I guess you might say to that damn tragic dark pump at the bottom of the

hill where potatoes are peeled, Oh Slave!

OH THAT CODY DREAM, last night he was all attentive as he never
really or only rarely is   in suit, suits always look new on him, with hair
wild and bushy not because uncombable but had been ruffled in the
coffee drinking, gabbling-at-bars excitement of the broad crazy dark
anddusty New York night  Now we wereon a sidewalk, like Paris side-
walk of Buferd-park-movie-house dream, saying goodbye to a segment
orgroup and then heading out together to later, wilder parties  as I say,
jike Errol Flynn and Bruce Cabot but ever so much beater and stranger,
really less simple and leas inacrutable. How tragic the sidewalks were 
along the order of Julien s when he in a dream came back or was back
from death inanapartment house with an elevator and his mother sweet,
white-faced, was willing for once to talk to me, the tragedy then was in
the very sidewalk out front. In fact Cody and I were in that general vicin-
ity which is like Sheridan Square (FBI tea dream), perhaps the Deni
Bleu one of that sun-slanting afternoon in Nick's when be got back from

"Brazil inreallife butreally anew Sheridan Square I ve been getting lately

(wherearethese messages from?) which I think is connected with Danny
Richman but positively connected (with aad Greek lunchcarts I dug
1939) with a girl  that pale sweet girl who lay like a great soft oyster
(Bev Watson) onacouch after unspoken agreement she disrobe and give
herself tomy hand although by that timescene had shifted from Sheridan
Square to a house in Maine or Lowell. Next Cody and | were in dark hall-
way of the senauallsts; party was up; I arranged for girls; Cody, for firat

time, followed me and let me do things. In other dreams when I go San

Francisco to see him, and we descend the mighty hills in a car, one time
hefell out of the car in one of his attempts to show driving tricks, I closed
my eyes exasperatedly to die but he miraculously jumped back into the

ear and righted it  in San Francisco | follow him, or alone go up long

Babylonian stairs (ferry, too) like the stairs in D. W. Griffiths  Feast of
Belshazzar in Intolerance to find the girls aver the ridge and down to the
swimmingpool, the little sweet Italian group I never refound in m'

  Cody and I  Iwas looking at tablecloth   thinking  I am tired, we do too

much, I must run away from Cody to ever rest but now he's following me
  Wlnevercan doit.  We're high on T and staring at wild designs of table-
cloth which are also dear familiar lunchcart check designs under the
ceiling fans of Oklahoma roadhouses as well as Mexico City tablecloth.
Main thing, Cody had given up and was following not me, but anybody
sweet and good and kind in the world, like he'd died and came over to see
me before his departure, dammit, into eternity. This was a dream last
night. And Cody let others do talking, for once was a smiling and be-
mused listener, like Irwin or everybody   He said something: "I'll only
be back for a short time but while I'm here you've got to take care of me,
understand?  you've got to see I don't get lonely, I don't know anybody

AND BETHESDA, AN EARLY NIGHT I SPENT thinking about my
FATE, how it was impossible for me to die (with loss, thatis) because of
charts, had-to-do s, SUPREME REALITY, and it was raining out; was
that first, no second ward when allowed myeelf to think in fate terms,
apparently because! was soon gettin out and back to merchant marine 
aware of Maryland, the Maryland forest in the night, rain on Wilderness,
went in bathroom to smoke and think just as recently at Kingsbridge Yd

and Arthur Godfrey on sunny porch (which was earlier nuttier pinetree

~ take meto the white one, the soft one you had on your couch there  Oh.
this is a cold dark town, man.  We talked and smoked with the sensual-
ists. Once I had a dream that a party was going on in a bleak little ho
standing all by itself in a dump lot the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge,
old eighteenth-century brick house with warehouse and gables, and
inside an orgy was going on, there were Negro sailors, Irwin Garden,
girl on her knees and suddenly the Brooklyn Bridge was burning a
these people didn t care, only the wild bourgeois who ran across
Bridge risking their lives with dogs under their arms. This Cody didn 
understand; he understood only Frisco and those soaring wild whit
house hills where my father once lived and rejected me, the time I
boo! in his cellar there at what I thought was a ghost and it was o

In the redbrick alley between B. F. Keith and Bridge Street Warehouse

Lowell, Mass. So I not only took care of Cody s understanding but pro-
tected him from horrors which he, unlike me, was not capable of absorb
ing. Yes he was strange, childlike, and as if, as I say, he had died or been
otherwise crippled in S.F. and:had come to see me prior to some s
journey from which he never was going to come back so naturally
took advantage, went to pains to arrange the best party with the
sualists, it was.a sort of dark ambiguous flop but Cody and I jumped  
made it. This dream followed the one about Crawford Street in Low
and the Kingsbridge Hospital, as if replacing it for special reasons wh
I decided to sleep some more. The next time I've a dream about Cody
they're rare I will note it: but now just let the only other rememberab!
dream of Cody I have serve our growing purposes  this is going to be
complete Cody  

Inseparably entwined with Joe my boyhood chum, I had flash of  
many-windowed wooden cell-house along Third Avenue and also
Joe's barn and Julien sjailship connecting with Cody   but this occurr:
when I wished to harken back to our discussion at the sensualists (I s
sensualists because one of them was that unspeakably sensual fag fro
Glennon s who talked with that young actor and me, part Rance
hipster, part more desperate than that, somehow a Cody hero) 

I said in effect toCody  If you worry about my attitude or have in the pa
towards homosexuality don't worry now, I have a new attitude  (a R
Yale Club party where I went with a kid in a leather jacket, I was wei

(36)

ing one too, and there were hundreds of kids in leather jackets instead of
big tuxedo Clancy millionaires and I yelled over to a gang  Buddy Van
Buder?  thinking it was Buddy Van Buder but they only smiled, cool,
and everybody was smoking marijuans, wailing anew decadein one wild
crowd)   not only that party but other things that also make me sad
though but I m fundamentally opposed on principle and because I don't
like it  but think how strange and charming it is that I understand it
now and in fact there was a blond amant at Josephine s, man~  To get
on with Denver: there was a cartoon moon shining over a boardfence,
a wild drugstore ice cream crowd on the corner, somewhat Reservoir
Hill-like, ricketiness, and then these tremendous brawling bars to which
Cody and I repaired for gabbling talks  apparently in my early dreams
of Cody it was bars not T-pads of sensualists I envisioned  asif Cody and
I were construction workers not dissipates who dissipate so much it
becomes a principle and finally a philosophy and finally a revelation 

That Denver had elements of Big Slim Washington and New Orleans,

had a strange New Haven empty lot with three-row house where I lived

(near trolley line, near water, where innumerable small craft sit in dry
canals and people celebrate along boardwalk which faces.a dry sea with
terrible raveled muds and spiders but in rain big tidal waves and storms
and naval battles start offshore, flashing Pow! in the rainy sea)~and a
New Orleans, n e Florida, which also has MexCity in it and I was in
MexicoCity with Cody. I've dreamed of Dave Sherman on a gray student

afternoon in MexicoCity which was in fact half on the Columbia campus

where I'd been flunking classes and goofing for years, cutting classes in

science for El rides into unknown upper New Yorks and failing to salute
the flag in front of the library with other boys who ate regularly in the
cellars that werevast like Lowell High School cellars. I know it isn t true,
but it seems to me Cody was stealing a suit during that happy afternoon
in MexCity with Sherman. These are the pitiful few dreams of Cody I
have is that all?

A GREAT AMERICAN INTERSECTION like the ones I will now go find
on the road to Cody with a White Tower on one corner, diner (new blue
cute kind with woman proprietor-waitress aays  Come on let's go  to
half-drunk eccentric) opposite, small beat white Mobilgas station an-
other corner (topped by red neoned flying redhorse, becluttered, white
curbs solled, car for sale, sign says Complete wheel alignment service
and Brakes relined, tires for sale, used, including one vast graypainted
truck tire), outdoor vegetable and fruit stand on the other (ice cold
watermelon, red like fire, we plug em).

Traffic lights shuttle this wild restless travel, cars nudging around
impatiently and even hitting dips near sewers to do so, panel trucks,

(37)
taxis, big trucks all mixed with cars, a four-direction confusion and anger
and also buses, tooting, wheeling, jumping by, sending up fumes, buses
growling, squeeking to stop, massing, surging, occasional sad pedes-
trians completely lost  a more interesting intersection further? Mainly,
though, this is, a sad white outside-of-town intersection openspaced,
stuccoed like buildings on Arapahoe Street in Cody's Denver, this is the
openspace whiteness which is always situated exactly halfway between
the country and downtown, so that when you come in to a new city you
always have to cross snowy suburban intersections like this  I ve seen
a building, originally redbrick one-story warehouse, located exactly at
this halfway spot between the highways of the land and the dense build-
ings downtown and it was painted white but had failed and the redbrick
showed through ~- to make a startling sight in all the pure hotdog road-
standand motel whiteness and in fact the gravel is almost white in these
nameless districts of U.S.A. Red traffic light gives it a sense of rain; the
green gives ita sense of distance, snow, sand 

IGOT EXCITED, I thought I'd go to the Coast without money anyway.

I wrote 2 letter to Cody:
 My trip to Frisco at last to stay with you and talk
with you and really be with ft 100% for any number
of inexpreasibly delicious weeks you wish; beyond
that even, Josephine wants to come, she wants to
hitch, adventures etc. of young girl digging the road,
she comes back via Lushy-Mushky Bust Colo. for her
Sis, of course Josephine wants to cuk 7 Fuck (what
mistakes dear me cuk 7 Fuck would be SOME FUCK)
and I was saying she wants to fuck and fuck (fuck
and fuck I meant to write but didn t capitalize the 7)
she wanted to fuck and fuck or that is fuck and fuck
and has or rather and has been doing so (all this in
imitation of you, you fool) and or rather doing so, Oh
for goodness sakes, here is the sentence, Josephine
wants to fuck and fuck and has been doing so with
Irwin and me regular as pie and spent 4 days with
me giving skull and getting skull, Mac and girl and
me and everything and everybody but kitchen sink,
weekend climaxed by my bringing colored guitarist
and pianiat and colored ga} and all three women took
off tops while we blew two hours me on bop-chords
piano, new Marty bop-tapdanced, guitar bongoed and
Mac fucked J. on bed, then I switched to bongo and
for one hour we really had a jungle (as you can imag-
ine) feeling running around, and after all there 1 was
with my brand new FINAL bongo or rather really

conga beat and looked up from my work which was
lifting the whole group (as if in prophecy of the fact
that you and I could be great jazz musicians among
jazz musicians) (they yelled GO) and what do I see
but this tall brown gal with a long white gleaming
pearl necklace hanging down between her black tits
clear to her black bellybutton, walking into parlor a
padding black feet, looking at me, etcetera, Cody yo

are, I believe, my last remaining complete great hid
1 don't think I'll ever have another like you for I might
retire in (Hke Swenson) so far, or go crazy or eccen-
tric of course somewhere along the line I'll end up
yakking with some wench in a black night, like Louis-
Ferdinand C line, like those lonely soldiers who come
back from Germany with six-foot-ten-years-older-than-
them Isolde warbrides and argue with them in bleak
rooms over drugstores, in bars, on church steps in
the middle of the night in winter if you see what I
mean, I mean bleak, sad, really mated, hung, like Bull
with June or a lushy Josephine doll of course but
aside from all that, I can t think of anybody and that
includes Swenson with whom I talked last night and
includes Irwin G. who, undoubtedly the greatest, just
doesn t give a shit (like Rappaport, aleo tremendous),
and certainly not Hayes, Bull etc., anybody who
knows the sum and substance of what 1 know and
feel and cry about in my secret self all the time when
I don t feel strong, the sorrows of time and personal-
ity, and can therefore on all levels make it all the way
with me  who knows and loves even jazz as 1 do, and
digs it as 1 do, who's been AROUND and then some.
I'm completely your friend, your  lover,  he who loves
you and digs your greatness completely  haunted in
the mind by you (think what that means, try to re-
verse, say, supposing you referred all your sensations
to somebody and wondered what they thought about
it) (that settles it: this letter includes a dream I had
of you two, three nights ago), supposing each time
you heard a delightfully original idea or were given
such an image that makes the mind sing you immedi-
ately slapped it over like one of those new office roller
files to'check with the CODY THING, that is, the Cody
constellation, and then on another level checked it
emotionally like to measure its amounts of awe that
you would bring to it. Last night Swenson spoke at
such great length on Gen t that I suddenly realized

(39)
(40)

(had innocently queried:  And Gen t? have considered
Gen ? ) he not only of course had considered Gen t,
every work published to date and incidentally reports
brought to him personally by people who know him,
reports about some recent new shift in Gen t s general
feeling or attack (and the reason I have no details is
because I wasn t listening, I was only dreaming over
the significance that overlayed or overiay the context
because it really to me was its rainbow) he even knew
in detail the characters of the books, the names of the
great mythological French queers of the underworld
Paris, Froufrou, Mimi, Ange Divine and the lot, every
nuance, like we know Buckle or Huck, knew them
intimately, had savored them at his longest and most
hungup leisure on nameless afternoons in that house
which he now occupies alone  cause his aunt died (and
think!: he misses her!  I've grieved just the proper
amount on the surface of it but it's rather  rather,
you know--after, one DOES realize, I just did wish
I'd been nicer to her, that s all, really ) (finally, after
a whole minute of his eyes struggling from their de-
mure downward cast to turn over to me, his face suf-
fusing with e sudden blush that seems to advertise
his glances, writhing with his one way while

his gorgeous enormous eyelids the other way,
in my direction, to reveal eyeballs in the act of rolling
with indescribably veiled languor, mixed with shy
shames and raptures of all kinds, as if from premed-
itated evil depths, from long private preparations no
man could ever dream was possible to the mind, minc-

  ing deliciously all over like this big lovely child that

reads the Apocalypse, wrapping himself around doors,
melting, like Bloom, most like Leopold Bioom in a
Dream, with his huge expressive and excessive nose
which is the indicator of all his directions and etcetera
the fingers.) 1 dig Swenson, 1 dig like you did, I dig
jazz, a 1000 things in America, even the rubbish in
the weeds of an empty lot, I make notes about it, I
know the secrets; I dig Joyce and Proust above Mel-
ville and C line, like you; and I dig you as we together
dig the lostness and the fact that of course nothing's
ever to be gained but death; ! only wanted to tell you
how great 1 think you are (after all). So hear my
plea write let me know if that attic s still open.

for the three, four weeks ! be there; hip me to any-
thing you can think of. Don't give me up, I m lost 

especially since her, I almost had no life in me this
summer, it s comeback (1 think) and right now, on
no more than a hangover from last night (Josephine
made a turkey, Irwin and I invited Swenson, Danny
Richman, Nardine, Peaches Martin (1) who's back
playing guitar and singing folk songs in Village and
separated from Hayes who has  black orchid  Indian
girl in MexCity and fears she'll find an  amant more
blond  while he pleads with medics for operations,
40 others, Julien Love and his fianc e and he immedi-
ately began breaking Josephine's expensive glasses
with tosses over his shoulder and she doing tit for

tat and even more pretended casual but with her own
destruction not his so later I tackled Julien maybe
because of this but he had something like a fit, a rigid
trembling popeyed fit and had to be led out of pad,
Irwin wagging his finger at me,  Julien is weak, leave
him alone  as if saying he was sick little boy, not
tackle him, and so on, and don t continue because
you dig Julien anyhow, in fact surmise if you will that
on way out he knocked over big hall table lamp and
landiord got on Josephine, you dig Julien anyhow and
I think he s  had it,  I guess ) from this night, when
also I got hi on Mexshit with Danny Richman to
Julien to Rappaport to girls in general to etcetera (and
all the time conscious of this awful Newyorkitis, this
inceasant drinking and talking always in a musty pad
not even cool but drunk, like when you were there
last trying to make a W. C. Fields show) (incidentally
I've since dug Levinski and he told me stories
about Huck in 1933, isn t that real choice?), drunk
and most of all all exhibitional like a bunch of god-
damn fools who can t grow up and dig anything but
themselves, that includes me, I need the fresh winds
of California, I start right after New Year's but from
this night, and its hangover, to return, I am conscious
of my own personal tragedy, my sleep, that is my
room itself is haunted by it at night when I sleep or
wake from a series of restless desperate images, catch-
ing myself in the act of shuffling the file cards of the
memory or the mind under the deck, aware also of
the tragedy, the loneliness of my mother. I have the
persistent feeling that I'm gonna die soon, only the
feeling, no real I think wish or  premonition,  I feel
like I've done wrong, to myself the most wrong, I'm
throwing away something that I can t even find in

the incredible clutter of my being but it s going out
with the refuse en masse, buried in the middle of it,

we returned from Frisco all that Watsonia and Bois-

ing~ but why did I waste 1949 with false understand-

why did I waste my beautiful MexCity on paranolas,

the street, digging available indications of what's going

standing in myriad rapid thought everything I sense
as it stands in front of me and activates all around,
in portable breast shirtpocket notebooks alapping),
advancing little by little to the point of knocking on
the door which will be exactly like those hot summer
afternoons when I used to pretend that I was dying
of thirst in the desert but an Arab chieftain found me
and took me to the hospitality of his tent, and laid a
glass of ice water in front of me, but said  You can
onty have it if you surrender your fort and your men,
and do it on your knees abjectly  and I agree, bowing
my head in tremendous heroic agony but seeing the
glass, the dews of the foggy rim, the ice clinking,
and plunging for it, raising it slowly to my lips, the
forbidden drink, that moment of actually taking the
first sip and appreciating water itself playinly, whee,
wow, you know what I mean, that s how I'm gonna
knock on your door which ain t any door.

Jack

P.S. Dear Evelyn,

I would have complied with your every wish immedi-
ately, in that letter of several months ago, if I'd had
half a chance   between hospital, troubles, having to
work and earn $ and everybody wants me to get drunk
1 had no idea how I'd ever get to Frisco or whether,
in spite of Cody's desperation with regard to his
loneliness on the level you mentioned, it was possible,
wise, healthy, etc. for me to try to go any old way;
but thaw Fin golag ontry it, in fact tartan Vetted tt
then. Now if Cody doesn t tell me about his REAL
troubles how can I know? Believe me, I suffer the
same as Cody from not seeing him once in a while 
and have to batter my head against the general empti-
ness when I want to explain something to so:

So anyway Evelyn, I hope I m still wanted; I'm Cody's
friend, not his devil. Ain't you by the way about to
run out of names for the kiddies? We never know
where we're going.

Love, Jack D.

AROUND THE POOLHALLS OF DENVER during World War H a
strange looking boy began to be noticeable to the characters who fre-
quented the places afternoon and night and even to the cagual visitors
who dropped in for a game of snookers after supper when all the tables
were busy in an atmosphere of smoke and great excitement and a con-
dnual parade passed in the alley from the backdoor of one poolroom on
Glenarm Street to the backdoor of another  a boy calied Cody Pomeray,
the son ofa Larimer Street wino. Where he came from nobody knew or at
first cared. Older heroes of other generations had darkened the walls of
the poolhalis long before Cody got there; memorable eccentrics, great
poolsharks, even killers, jazz musicians, traveling salesmen, anonymous
frozen bums who came in on winter nights to sit an hour by the heat
never to be seen again, among whom (and not to be remembered by any-
one because there was no one there to keep a love check on the majority

(47)
of the boys as they swarmed among themselves year by year with only
casual but sometimes haunted recognition of faces, unless strictly local
characters from around the corner) was Cody Pomeray, Sr. who in his
hobo life that was usually spent stumbling around other parts of town
had somehow stumbled in here and sat in the same old bench which
was later to be occupied by his son in desperate meditations on life.
Have you ever seen anyone like Cody Pomeray? say on a street-
corner on a winter night in Chicago, or better, Fargo, any mighty cold
town, a young guy with a bony face that looks like it's been pressed
against iron bars toget that dogged rocky look of suffering, perseverance,
finally when you look closest, happy prim self-belief, with Western side-
burns and big blue flirtatious eyes of an old maid and fluttering lashes;
the small and muscular kind of fellow wearing usually a leather jacket
and if it's a suit it's with a vest so he can prop his thick busy thumbs in
place and smile the smile of his grandfathers; whowalks as fast as he can
goon the balls of his feet, talking excitedly and gesticulating; poor pitiful
kid actually just out of reform schoo! with no money, no mother, and if
you saw him dead on the sidewalk with a cop standing over him you'd
walk on ina hurry, in silence. Oh life, whois that? There are some young
men you look at who seem completely safe, maybe just because of  
Scandinavian ski sweater, angelic, saved; on a Cody Pomeray it im-
mediately becomes a dirty stolen sweater worn in wild sweats. Some-
thing about his tigerish out-jutted raw fecebone could be given a woe-
down melancholy if only he wore a drooping mustache (a famous bop
drummer who looked just like Cody at this time wore such a mustache
and probably for those reasons). It is a face that's so suspicious, so
energetically upward-looking like people in passport or police lineup
photos, so rigidly itself, looking like it's about to do anything unspeak-
ably enthusiastic, in fact so much the opposite of the rosy Coke-drinking
boy in the Scandinavian ski sweater ad, thatin front of a brick wall where
it says Post No Bills andit's too dirty for a rosy boy ad you can imagine
Cody standing therein the raw gray flesh manacled between sheriffs and
Assistant D.A. sand you wouldn't have to ask yourself who is the culprit
and who is the law. He looked like that, and God bless him he looked like
that Hollywood stunt man who is fist-fighting in place of the hero and:
has such aremote, furious, anonymous viciousness (one of the loneliest
things in the world to see and we've all seen it a thousand times in a
- thousand B-movies) that everybody begins to be suspicious because
they know the hero wouldn't act like that in real unreality. If you've been
a boy and played on dumps you've seen Cody, all crazy, excited and full
of gloe-mad powers, giggling with the pimply girls in back of fenders
and weeds till some vocational school swallows his ragged blisses and
that strange Americaniron which later is used to mold the suffering man-

(48)

face is now employed to straighten and quell the long wavering spermy
disorderliness of the boy. Nevertheless the face of a great hero a face
oremind you that the infant springs from the great Assyrian bush of a
man, not from an eye, an ear or a forehead  ~ the face of a Sim n Boltvar,
gobert E. Lee, young Whitman, young Melville, a statue in the park,
ough and free.
The appearance of Cody Pomeray on the poolroom scene in Denver at
avery early age was the lonely appearance of a boy on a stage which had
been trampled smooth in a number of crowded decades, Curtis Street
and also downtown; a scene that had been graced by the presence of
champions, the Pensacola Kid, Willie Hoppe, Bat Masterson re-passirig
through town when he was a referee, Babe Ruth bending toa sidepocket
shot on an October night in 1927, Old Bull Balloon who always tore
greens and paid up, great newspapermen traveling from New York to
San Francisco, even Jelly Roll Morton was known to have played pool in
the Denver parlors for a living; and Theodore Dreiser for all we know
pending an elbow in the cigarsmoke, but whether it was restaurateur
kings in private billiard rooms of clubs or roustabouts with brown arms
just in from the fall Dakote harvest shooting rotation for a nickel in
Little Pete's, it was in any case the great serious American poolhall night
and Cody arrived on the scene bearing his original and sepulchral mind
with him to make the poolhall the headquarters of the vast excitement of
the early Denver days of his life becoming after awhile, a permanent
gnusing figure before the green velvet of table number one where the
intricate and almost metaphysical click and play of billiard balls be-
came the background for his thoughts; till later the sight of a beautifully
reverse-Englished cuebal] leaping back in the air, after a cannonading
 shot at another ball belted straight in, bam, when it takes three soft
bounces and settles back on the green, became more than just the back.
ground for daylong daydreams, plans and schemes but the unutterable
realization of the great interior joyful knowledge of the world that he
s beginning to discover in his soul. And at night, late, when poolhalls
white and garish and eight tables are going fullblast with all the
s and businessmen milling with cues, Cady knew, he knew every-
thing like mad, sitting as though he wasn t noticing anything and not
thinking anything on the hard onlooker s bench and yet noticing the
special excellence of any good shot within the aura of his eyeball and not
only that, the pecullarities and pitiful typehood of every player whether
someover-flamboyant kid with his eleventh or twelfth cigarette dangling
from his mouth or some old potbellied rotation wizard who's left his
lonely wife in a varnished studio room above a Rooms sign in the dark
of Pearl Street, he knew it all. z
The first to notice him was Tom Watson. Tom was a hunchbacked

(49)
poolshark with the great moon blue eyes of a saint, an extremely
character, one of the smartest well-known shots of the younger g
tion in the locality. Cody couldn t have been more than fifteen years
when he wandered in from the street. It was only that many years b
in 1927, that Cody was born, in Salt Lake City; at a time when for so
Godforsaken reason, some forgotten, pitiably American, restless rez
his father and mother were driving in a jalopy from Iowa to L.A.
search of something, maybe they figured to start an orange grove
find a rich uncle, Cody himself never found out, 2 reason long buried
the sad heap of the night, a reason that nevertheless in 1927 caused th
to fix their eyes anxiously and with throat-choking hope over the
swath of brokendown headlamps shining brown on the road .
road that sorrowed into the darkness and huge unbelievable Ameri
nightland like an arrow. Cody was born ina charity hospital. A few
later the jalopy clanked right on; so that now there were three pairs
eyes watching the unspeakable road roll in on Pa s radiator cap
steadfastly penetrated the night like the poor shield of themselves,
little Pomeray family, lost, the gaunt crazy father with the flo
slouched hat that made him look like a brokendown Okie Shadow,
dreaming mother in a cotton dress purchased on a happier afterns
some excited Saturday five-and-ten, the frightened infant. Poor mot
of Cody Pomeray, what were your thoughts in 1927? Somehow or ot
they soon came back to Denver over the same raw road; somehow:
other nothing worked out right the way they wanted; without a
they had a thousand unspecified troubles and knotted their fis:
despair somewhere outside a house and under a tree where someth
went wrong, grievously and eternally wrong, enough to kill people;
the loneliness, remorse and chagrin in the world piled on their
like indignities from heaven. Oh mother of Cody Pomeray, but was
secretly in you a lovely memory of a Sunday afternoon back home
you were famous and beloved among friends and family, and young 
when maybe you saw your father standing among the men, lau
and you crossed the celebrated human floor of the then-pai
beloved stage to him. Was it from lack of life, lack of haunted pain
memories, lackof sons and trouble and humiliated rage that you died,
was it from excess of death? She died in Denver before Cody was
enough to talk to her. Cody grew up with a childhood vision of
standing in the strange antique light of 1929 (which is no different #
the light of today or the light when Xerxes  fleets confused the waves,
Agamemnon wailed) in some kind of livingroom with beads hang
from the door, apparently at a period in the life of old Pomeray w

Street, making futile attempts to work and periodically leaving Cody
with his wife's people to go to Texas to escape the Colorado winters,
beginning a lifetime swirl of hoboing into which little Cody himself was
gucked later on, when at intervals, childlike, he preferred leaving the
security of his Ma s relatives which included sharing a bedroom with his
sepbrother, going to school, and altar-boying at a local Catholic church,
for going off to live with his father in flophouses. Nights long ago on
the brawling sidewalks of Larimer Street when the Depression hobo was
there by the thousands, sometimes in great sad lines black with soot in
therainy dark of Thirties newsreels, men with sober downturned mouths
puddied in old coats waiting in line for misery, Cody used to stand in
front of alleys begging for nickels while his father, red-eyed, in baggy
pants, hid in the back with some old bum crony called Rex who was no
 King but just an American who had never outgrown the boyish desire to
fiedownon the sidewalk which he did the year round from coast to coast;
thetwoof them hiding and sometimes having long excited conversations
until the kid had enough nickels to make up 2 bottle of wine, when it was
time to hit the liquor store and go down under ramps and railroad em-
bankments and light a small fire with cardboard boxes and naily boards
and sit on overturned buckets or oily old treestumps, the boy on the
ater edges of the fire, the men in its momentous and legendary glow,
 and drink the wine.  Wheeool Hand me that damn bottle 'fore 1 knock
gomebody s head in! 

-  And this of course was just the chagrin of bums suddenly becoming
wild joy, the switchover from all the poor lonely woe of the likes of
Pomeray having tocount pennies on streetcorners with the wind blowing
is dirty hair over his snarling, puffy, disgruntled face, the revulsion of
bums burping and scratching lonely crotches at flophouse sinks, their
agony waking up on strange floors (if floors at.all) with their mad minds
reeling in a million disorderly images of damnation and strangulation in
a world too unbearably disgusting to stand and yet so full of useless
sweet and nameless moments that made them cry that they couldn't say
Bo to it completely without committing some terrified sin, attacked
repeatedly by every kind of horrible joy making them twitch and marvel
and gasp as before visions of heart-wrenching hell penetrating up
through life from unnumberable hullabalooing voices screaming in
insanity below, with piteous memories, the sweet and nameless ones,
that reached back to fleecy cradle days to make them sob, finally bound
to sink to the floor of brokendown pisshouses to wrap around the bowl
and maybe die this misery with a bottle of wine was twisted around
like a nerve in old man Pomeray's brain and the tremendous joy of the
Teally powerful drunk filled the night with shouts and wild bulging
 power-mad eyes. On Larimer Street Cody's father was known as The

days when he would grow up and spend useless hours looking at nudist
magazines at the corner newsstand; sometimes, though, only fixing his
eyes on the mosaic of the tiles on the barbershop floor where he d long
imagined each little square could be peeled back endlesaly, tiny leaf by
tiny leaf, revealing in little microcosmic encyclopedia the complete his-
tory of every person that ever lived as far back as the beginning, the whole
thing a blinding sight when he raised his eyes from one tile and saw

past the slats of the boxoffice in drowsical midafternoon, the lady of the
tickets dreaming with nothing to do as from the dank maw of the movie,
cool, dark, perfumed with seats, where bums slept and Mexican children
stared, there roared the gunshots and hoofbeats of the great myth of the
American West represented by baggy-eyed riders who drank too much
in Encienega Boulevard bars galloping in the moonlight photographed
from the back of a truck in California dirt roads, with a pathetic human
plot you sometimes think is worked in to make everybody overlook who
theriders really are. What disappointment little Cody felt never having a
dime, or eleven cents to see the show; not even a penny sometimes to
spend all the time he wanted selecting a chocolate candy from a lovely
becluttered counter in a poor dim candy store run by an old Syrian
woman in a shawl where also there were celluloid toys gathering dust as
those same immortal clouds passed over the, street outside; the same
disappointment he felt on those nights when he sat amidst the haha-ing
harsh yellings of those bums under the bridge with the bottle, when he
knew that the men who wererich tonight were his brothers but they were
brothers who had forgotten him; when he knew that all the excited ac-
tions of life which included even the pitiful getting of the night's wine by
bis father and Rex led to the grave, and when suddenly beyond the
freightyards towards the mountain darkness inhabited by great stars,
where nevertheless and amazingly in a last hung dusk a single flame of
the sun now making long shadows in the Pacific lingered high on Bert-
boud's mighty wall as the world turned silently, he could hear the Denver

gap to begin the train order climb to the dews, jackpines, arid windy
heights of the mountain night, pulling the sad brown boxcarsof the world

towns of smoke and lunchcarts, for all he knew as he sat there with his
tagged sneakers stuck in the oily yard and among the sooty irons of his
fate, to the glittering San Francisco fogs and ships. Oh little Cody

_ for a spot remover venture and where pinochle at a busted dusty rolltop
desk consumed thirty-six hours of their fevered reprieve, to a farm out-
_ side town (now abandoned by some family and left to Old Bull) and
where drinking was done in barns and ruined livingrooms or out in cold
alfalfa rows, finally teetering back downtown, Pomeray migrating back
to the railyards to collapse beneath Rex in a pool of urine beneath drip-
ping ramps while Old Bull Balloon s huge pukey tortured bulk was

little Cody woke up in the car on a cald clear October morning and didn t
know what todo, Gaga, the beggar without legs whoclattered tragically
gn hisrollerboard on Wazee Street, took him in, fed him, made him a bed
on the floor like a bed of straw and spent the night thundering around in
bulge-cyed sweat trying to catch him in a foul hairy embrace that would
 have succeeded if he d had legs or Cody hadn't lowered himself out the
transom.

Years of hopping around with his father like this and on freight trains
allover the West and so many futilities everywhere that he d never re-
member them all, and then Cody had a dream that changed his life en-
rely. It was in reform school, after the theft of his first car and when
he hadn t seen his Pa for a year. He dreamed he lived In an immense cos-
mic flophouse dormitory with the old man and Rex and other bums, but
that it was somehow located in the Denver High School auditorium;
that one night he was walking across the street in an exhilarated state,
carrying a mattress under his arm; all up and down the street with its
October night lights glittering clear swarmed the bums, with his father
off somewhere doing something busy, excited, feverish. In the dream
Cody was thirty years older; he wore a T-shirt in the brisk weather; his
beer belly bulged slightly over the belt. His arms were the muscular arms
of an ex-boxer growing flabbier. His hair was combed slick but it was
thinning back from bony frowns and Mephistophelean hairlines. His
face was his own butit was strangely puffed, beaten, the nose in fact was
almost broken, a tooth was missing. When he coughed it sounded harsh

(33)

and hoarse and maniacally excited like his father. He was going some-
where to sell the mattress for wine money: his exhilaration was due to
the fact that he was going to succeed and get the money. And suddenly his
father wearing his old black baseball hat came stumbling up the streat
with a convulsive erection in his baggy pants, howling hoarsely  Hey
Cody, Cody, did you sell the mattress yet? Huh, Cody, did you sell the
mattress yet?   and ran clutching after him with imploration and fear;
adream that Cody woke from with a repugnance that only he could un-
derstand. It wasdawn; he lay on the hard reformatory bed and decided to
start reading books in the library so he would never be a bum, no matter
what he worked at to make a living, which was the decision of a great
idealist.

At fifteen this child had the regimen of his life worked out in a con-
fused and still and all pathetically practical way. He rose at 7 a.m. from
Old Bull Balloon s rolltop desk (his current bed); if the office wes filled
with poker players he slept in the bathtub of the Greeley or other hotels.
At 7:15 he rushed downtown, washed at barbershop sink, if it was not
available he used the YMCA sink. Then he delivered his paper route.
Around nine he went to the Smith residence, where he knew a near-idiot
maid thathe made love toon the cellar cot, after which she always fed him
a big meal. If this friendship with idiot maid sometimes failed he ran to
Big Cherry Lucy's at the Texas Lunch (ever since thirteen Cody was
able to handle any woman and in fact had pushed his drunken father off
Cherry Lucy Halloween night 1939 and taken over so much that they fist

fought likerivals and Cody ran away with the five dollar stake). Atten he
rushed to the library for the grand opening, read Schopenhauer and
magazines (sometimes when he wasn t reading funnies as a child he'd
getareal book off theold Greeley Hotel shelf and read dwn over the firat
words of every line Chinese style in childly thought, which is early phi-
losophizing). At eleven o'clock he asked to wash cars and sometimes
asked to parkcars at the Rocky Mountain Garage (already he could drive
better than any attendant in Denver and in fact had stolen several other
cars to try his skill since his time in the  joint  and parked them back on
the same block intact except for change of position), noon hour he used a
paper route friend s bike to ride five miles out to friends  families for big
meals, then helped with chores till two. Back to library for afternoon.
reading, history, encyclopedias and the bloody sad amazing Lives of the
Saints, and making use of the library toilet; four o'clock rest and medita-
tion and connections in poolhall till closing time unless semipro twilight
baligame or other spectacles of interest sprung around town; eleven
o'clock he stole nickels off newsstands for a Bowery beefstew and found

the place to sleep.

yr WAS A SATURDAY AFTERNOON in Denver, October, 1942, when
"Yom Watson first saw pure-souled Cody sitting on that bench with his

was only dreaming there; wearing Levi dungarees, old shoes without

with car grease, and carrying a brand new toy accordion in a box he had
gust found by the side of the road, perched among the usual great num-
perof Saturday onlookers half of whom were waiting for tables and talk-
ing about everything that had happened during the week, the kind of
things that made Cody feel like a sheepish fool with no news of his own

interesting tales, even while Watson said to himself  Must be some

whole groups of them shouted across the smoke to other fellows in a
tremendous general anticipation of the rapidly approaching almost
_ynbearably important Saturday night in just a few hours, right after
pper when there would be long preparations before the mirror and
then a sharped-up city-wide invasion of bars (which already at this
 moment had begun toroar fromold afternoon drinkers who'd swallowed
their bar egos long ago), thousands of young men of Denver hurrying
from their homes with arrogant clack and tic-adjustments towards the
rilliant center in an invasion haunted by sorrow because noguy whether
he was a big drinker, big fighter or big cocksman could ever find the
center of Saturday night in America, though the undone collar and the
dumb stance on empty streetcorners on Sunday dawn was easy to find
and in fact fifteen-year-old Cody could have best told them about it; the
premonition of this oncoming night together with the dense excitement

womany glee trotting around town buying boxes of soap, Jell-o, floor

their wagons, then working up to apples at the fruitstand, containers of
ik, toilet paper, half crushable items like that, finally chops, steak,
bacon pyramiding to eggs, cigarettes, the grocery slip all mixed up with
hew toys, new socks and housedresses and lightbulbs, eagering after
every future need while their men-louts slammed around with balls and
facksand sticks in the dimness of their own vice. And there in the middle

It was toocompletely mad for flabbergasted dumb old Tom Watson,
one of the kindest fellows in the world, who in any case could never be
expected to even have the energy to face a thousand miles of deliberately
absurd travel in a clonking old heap, no, Watson's first, real, and genu-
inely kind impulse was to quiet Cody down.

 My land,  he said to himself,  he s practically crazy from being
hungry I bet! 

He took him home that afternoon to his grandmother's house. They
hada big snack from the icebox, Cody drinking two and a half quarts of
milk in fear that he'd never see that much for several more years, and
making sure not to tear the bread when he folded it over the butter,
clutching his chest, actually clutching his chest when he realized Wat-
son's grandmother was only standing over them to refill their glasses
from a fresh bottle of milk, not pleased or displeased but just a nice old
woman with a rosy moon face, glasses, white hair, wearing cotton
 stockings over her piano legs that supported her so firmly and unmov-
ably in the halos of her bright linoleum and a housedress that in the
course of tender chores around the house which was as comfortable as
an old pillow, had taken on the kindly, almost dear shapelessness of her
 herself, the simplicity and sadness of her stolid motherlike repose at the
poor hunchbacked boy's side as he bent to his supper, her grandson
whom she served and honored, enough to make Cody feel like crying for
his own mother whom he was positive now would have been something
like Watson's grandmother, just as calm, plain, humble, like old women
swho run rickety grocery stores in dumpy backyard neighborhoods of
trees and woodfences. In Watson's bedroom upstairs the boys spent a
quiet hour facing each other at a folding cardtable set near the window
where the lace curtains puffed in with the breeze and played over the
flowery wallpaper and knickknacks of windowshelf, the mere sight of
this graceful drowsy phenomenon making Cody marvel and enjoy life
{always high at fifteen) to be in a real home that had lace curtains and
little feminine lonely frills in it to beat harsh nature, as Watson, not
realizing that Cody was thinking these kinds of thoughts, proceeded in a
thorough explanation of the various first steps in cheating at cards.

 First off you see Cody you mark  em best with your thumbnail like
this, usin your own code if you like, to designate face cards, acies and
deucies, 

"Yesl  cried Cody,  Yes indeed! 

(61)
From a closet next to a dark wood dresser with carved iron grips
that swung on little hinges in rich significant clicks, and next to the
right front bedpost of Watson's fourpost manorial boxspring bed in
which Cody imagined Watson slept like the little boys in fleecy night-
gowns in mattress advertisements of the Saturday Evening Post, which
herealized now he was confusing with a rubber tire ad that shows a little
boy wandering out of bed with a candle on New Year's Eve but expresses
the same tender comfort of angels and vision of American children (ah
poor Gody who'd seen this vision in those soaked magazines that have
been dried by thesun and stand on tattered edges among weeds and cun-
drums of backlots), from that closet that seemed too rich because it was
next to these things and inside had the luxuriant darkness of suits all
flashing dim from starry moth crystals (and their starry odor) and the
faint gold of shoetrees, Watson pulled out a fairly good brown tweed
suit and, with a slight bow like a Viennese nobleman, like the Bela
Lugosi vampire Count bowing to the young hero at the door of the rainy
castle, he presented it 10 Cody to keep, Cody in turn offering his toy ac-
cordion as collateral anyway, with a smile and still bowing Watson
saying he'd keep it for him. It was Cody's first suit: he buiged out of the
new clean underwear; bulged out of the starched white shirt that was
handed to him with a laundry cardboard brace in the collar that made.
him wonder if he had to fiddle with it like irascible millionaire husbands
tugging before last minute mirrorsin B-movies, he bulged out of the neck-
tie that wound foursquare around the pillars of his neck, but out of the
suit he exploded, the buttons were in danger of popping, the trouser
creases were stretched flat out of sight on his thighs, the back seams of
the coat showed connective spinal threads, the sleeves tock the shape of
his forearms that suddenly looked almost as big as Popeye's.

 Damn! Do I lock sharp? 

He looked alright but strange. So awed by these new clothes that he
could hardly turn his head when Watson talked to him, but only nodded
up and down, his long hair bushy and uncombable, his thoughts ali
pompous sweaty astonishment like the cartoon characters they draw
with bewildered perspirations raining from their heads, justas ludicrous
as that, and yet es that bright afternoon that had shed its radiance un-
asked for so long now showed itself to be turned into old red afternoon
when they stepped forth from the house, and piteous remorse among
men, birds, and trees that had transpired while they were dressing still
haunted theair with that hung silence that makes people ask themselves
sadly  Oh what happened to the afternoon?  and later when the general
autumn dying quietly like a brave soldier overwhelms them,  Oh what
happened to the year? , Cody, very like an Episcopalian farmer boy
going to church the Sunday morning before his wedding and with th

(62)

- game absent-minded ignorance of the wide surroundment brooding
over him that characterizes all mortal persecuted breath beneath this
bugeness, literally had to be led stupidly and stiffly down the strest by
Watson as they hurried back to the pool parlor to meet the entire gang.
It was going to be a big night, suit and all. It didn t take long for Cody to
quicken his steps with Watson's and soon they had pinpointed down-
streetand wereswinging around thecorner toa big trolley line thorough-
fare, hurrying for the big-traffic, ever-more-exciting, all-of-it-pouring-
into-town Saturday night, bothof them with the same bright fresh gleam
in their eyes that you see on the shiny fender of a new automobile when it
turns in from the darkness and outskirts of town and immediately re-
fiects Saturday night Main Street neons where before it just sat black in
a dark garage or else in the driveway collecting dim dressing lights from
the upstairs of the house, vanishing like a comedy team rightward in a
vision of ankles twinkling in the dusk with regardant bending figures
pointed downtown plunging through the same pocket of excitement
which was not only their point of sober discussion but raised little fogs
from their mouths as they yaketty-yakked along (with lone envy Cody
used to watch other guys cutting along like this, sometimes from Mission
reading-room windows on nights when it was socold he thought he could
_ read what the buddies said before their intense voluminous talking-fogs
whipped back to dissolve in wintry eternity); Cody finally forgetting he
was wearing a suit, forgetting the high entrapment of the collar and the
woolly stifling around his armpits and the unfamiliar scuffling cuffs out
of which he soon in fact resumed telling Watson further things and all
things about himself, gesturing out of the shiny round starch his big
grimy cracked hands that werenot at all the hands of an absorbed banker
_inthestreet but morelikea dirt farmer's at a funeral and worse like horny
toads ina basket of wash.  Now in Gaga's barbershop in back and setting
way up high behind the water hester I have a bag of clothes, harkening to
_ clothes, but togoand pick it up involves terrible divisions with Gaga over
money my old man owed him even though it s just old pants and belts
and potkadot shirts, but further I have an extry pair of fairly good work-
_shoes settin way up high so nobody can notice on top of a locker in the Y
and my plan, actually and no lie, was getting down to Colorado Springs
or Raton or some such to freeze m'fingers off in construction camps or
whichever    and soon as Watson assured him he hed plenty of clothes
_ for him and not to worry. Excitement of hurrying downtown on foot for
_ the big night reached a supreme peak when suddenly as they rushed arm-
_tarmandcametocross Broadway the light instantly changed for them
_-andthey didn t have to wait but just hustled right straight on across the
street for the poolhall, that light that wouldn't allow lulls in the rhythm
of theirjoy holding up whole avenues of traffic exactly for them to sweep

(63)

along, profound, bowed, bumping heads together; Cody so singing in
his soul now that he had to talk on several levels to express himself to
Watson:  Even thoughas you aay there's just as much work around here
and why even go to Fort Collins where it's so c-o-l-d (whee! zoom! look at
that new Cadillac!) and I didn t further finish about earlier speaking of
Gaga and all the things I want you to know  ; his arm around Watson,
tight armpits or no tight armpits, he the only one who'd ever put his arm
around the hump of Watson's sorrow; similarly in the moment, seeing,
justas they reached the other curb, in the exciting shadows of a five-and-
ten swning and to his deeper and simultaneously running amazement,

- a beautiful girl fixing on him from her casual one-leg-forward hand-on-
hip position by the weighing machine waiting for the bus a cold arrogant
look of sensuality done with misty eyes and something suggestive, impa-
tient, almost too personal to understand, astonishing him in the realiza-
tion that he was wearing a suit for the first time In his life and this was the
first official sex-appeal look from a regular high-heeled downtown so-
clalite honey (still finding room to yell  Watson watch that new Caddy
beat the light now!)  and reflecting:  So this is what these damn dames
and big guys been doing, giving each other turble personal glances of
angry snaky love that I didn t know about in my previous boy days beatin
around the sidewalk with my eyes on the gutter looking for nickels and
dimes wearin goldang cockin old pants. Damn! Lessgo! 

In the poothall the hour was roaring. It was so crowded that specta-
tors were standing obscuring everything from the street and somebody
had the backdoor open simultaneously with the alley door of the Welton
Street parlor so that you could see a solid city block of poolhall from the
north side of Glenarm to the south side of Welton interrupted only by  
little tragic alley of shadows with a garbage can, like looking down a hall
of mirrors over a sea of angrily personalized heads and islands of green
velvet, all in smoke, To Cody it was a vision, the moment of his arrival
that everybody was waiting for, yet even though he stood in the door at
the side of great cool Tom Watson the Virgil of this big Inferno, wearing
not only his clothes but the same gorgeously sophisticated robe of their
afternoon's adventure which was already undergoing a rich change to
evening and the lazy explorations that were to come, a decadent refine-
ment that all the dumb bastards in this dimness would have to struggle
tounderstand toknow anything hereafter even about pool, nobody made
@ move to notice or even gave much of a crap and Cody would have im-
mediately felt drowned again except suddenly for the saving memory of
a hunch he used to have in boyhood which was whenever he turned his
back on the people who were involved with him and even others whe
happened to be standing nearby, perfect strangers sometimes, they im-
mediately gathered with the speed of light at the nape of his neck to dis-
cuss him voicelessly, dancing, pointing, until, jerking his head around

(64)

for @ quick look or just slowly to check, it turned out they'd always
twanged back in place with all-to-be-expected fiendish perfect hypocrisy
and in exactly the same bland position as before. Remembering anyhow
his father when in his cocky way of bums used to stagger happily into
some place howling  Hallelujah I'm a bum, bum again  Cody as he came
in, very carefully digging everything through shrewd half closed eyes so
he could size up and savor the scene for everything it had, jazzing on the
balls of his feet in that thing Americans do instead of pinching them-
selves, now repeated the song to himself,  Hallelujah I m a bum, bum
again,  in a secret, sly, interested whisper of his own he always used to
refer back to sad factors of the past. While Watson was busy looking
around, Cody directed his attention toa apot on the floor near table num-
ber one where, after he had got tired looking at people on those long
watchful nights, he used to spend stranger further hours on the on-
Jookers  bench absentmindedly studying the reality and vying with the

- existenceof cigarette butts and spit by estimating exactly how it got there

on the floor, wondering why for instancea particular calm spit gleamed
like it did even though it had been rejected like a person's rejected and
spat out exactly (by the clock) two and a half minutes earlier by a blue-
jowled conductor who had to spit and wouldn't have spat otherwise but
cameapparently tothink of something completely different at the button
wire counting the score and scratching his chin (all as voices of the fel-
lows reverberated around the wails of the hall and moaned in his absent
not-listening ear), so that as far as the spot of this conductor s own spit

: was concerned it no longer existed for him, only for Cody; Cody then

estimating exactly how he himself got there, not only the world but the
bench, not only the bench but the part of the bench he filled out, not only
that but how he got there to be aware of the saliva and the part of the
bench his ass filled out, andsoon in the way the mind has; at all of which
now because it wasn t his best idea of what to do in a poolhall, in Wat-
son's company he made his ceremonial sneer and official revenge, even
in the roaring noise and even though among all these Saturday feet he
couldn't quite see the exact spot he had studied, though he knew there
were new cigarette butts and spit on that spot now, like little brothers
and sisters following in the stead of others long ago studied and swept
away, in any case doing all this so that the first full-fledged moment of
his poolhall charactership would not be spoiled in fevers and forgetful

* excitement like running up to people to talk, but instead he would take

advantage of his big chance to keep his attention disciplined on his good
luck, and so do so in the roots of previous well-conside-ed sorrow of
October in the Poothall.

 Whatare you doing Cody?  asked Watson when he noticed how pen-

 sive he was.

Oh ragged sailing heart!   it was far from time for Cody to be able to"
(65)
even want toexpiain his craziest secrets.  Actually and no lie, Tom, I wag
thinking to myself what a wonderful guy this Tom Watson fellow is really
truly indeed. 

Slim Buckle, Earl Johnson and Jim Evans were the nucleus of Tom
Watson s gang at the time. They were grouped around a rear table in the
usual ritual get-together game of rotation that they hed every Saturday
evening as a kind of preliminary tactical conference on the night's action
and for starting and a Coke. The program tonight featured two girls wha
were baby-sitting for the weekend in a house up near the Wyoming line.
But this night without knowing it they were grouped around with that

hotheaded dumbness the purpose of which is always to be ignorant of
what's about to happen, the only sure thing you can remember when you.
look back to see what people were doing during an important historical
moment, sore, sullen, sighing from the drag of time, inattentive as

always, impatient not only with life but always exactly the life unfolding

in the immediate vicinity, the miserable here, thelousy now, asthough all
the blame was on that,and yet the poor souls actually sitting in that mys-
terious godlike stuff that later makes them say,  Listen, I was there the

night Tom Watson came in with Cody the day he found him, 1942, Au-
tumn, they had the Army-Columbia game that day I bet on it and heard &

on the radio too, we were all playing pool me and Slim Buckle who just

got haircuts and Earl Johnson and Jackoff and I dunno who the hell else,
Christ we all drove to Wyoming that night, sure, it was a great mad
night!"

Cody was introduced around.  Here conies Tom Watson; who's that
kid with him? What's that, your cousin? What happened to you and
Jackoff Friday night? Cody is it? Hiya boy.  And Cody with that strange:
little feeling of pleasedness that shivers deep in your chest and makes

you want to hug yourself and explain everything to the man next to you,
found himself standing at one table among all the others roaring with:

what he could now almost call his own gang as exciting shadows out-
doors fell and they played eightball Cody and Watson versus Buckle
and Johnson with goodnatured Evans kibitizing, And everything they
said   Thatold Missouri twang Esmeralda swishin her butt around the
Sandwich Shop I know her, if she had as many rods stickin out of her as.
she had in she'd look like a porcupine, yah, don't laugh I stole it from
Tony    and everything they did ~ one reaching up to slap over the score
and another reaching down to carefully place his Coke and another look-
ing horizontally along his cue to see if it was too curved  was all part of
one great three-dimensional moil that was all around him now instead
of just flat in front of his face like a canvas prop, he was up on the stage
with the show now. So he stood there with his weatherbeaten face grow-
ing more excited and redder by the hour, his big raw hands gripped

(66)

round a cue, looking bashfully at bis new friends and planning deep
jn bis mind from everything they said and did the positively best, in fact
only way to begin completely, helplessly impressing everyone and win-
ning over their favor so conclusively and including their souls that
eventually of course they would ail turn to him for love and advice; mad
Cody who eventually did run the gang, who was now just being merely

coy quiet knowing instinctively the best way to start despite the fact

that he never knew a gang before and the only thing he'd done was grab
poor kid by the arm in the junkyard or a newsboy in the street or
someof the bicyclists on the paper route and make long strange speeches
to them like the great speech he made to Watson that afternoon but they
were too young to understand and frightened. So he stood stiffly at atten-
tion at the table side, sweaty in his suit, or made stupid hilarious shots
laying out his big hand flat and flaccid for a cue-rest as if a baby was try-

{ng to shoot pool, and the boys laughed but only because Cody was so

iously absent-minded in his hilarious dumbness (trying to learn, they
thought) and not because he was inconsequential. Right away the
biggest fellow in the gang took a liking to Cody, six-foot-four Slim Buckle
all shiny handsome in his Saturday night suit, who was alwaya looming

at his vest most of the time, a fate that he accepted with immense and

tender satisfaction. This goodnatured long tall drink of water took a

liking to Cody that soon became hero worship and later led to their
rambling around the country, buddies a thing that Earl Johnson
noticed and resented from the start. He was almost instantly Jealous and
immediately proclaimed next day in Watson's ear (when it was too late)
Cody wasn t everything he seemed to be. So when the gang gave up the
precious table and let their empty Cokes plop in a floorbox with a  So
long fellers" and left the hall to jump in the car, a  37 Ford belonging
to Evans, for the ride north to Wyoming about eighty miles, the sun just
then going down in vast unobserved event above the madding souls of
people, and Cody above the objections of everyone else insisted on driv-
ing to show his skill, but then really fantastically wheeled the car right

bow to be impressive with highschool principals Mannerly now
stopped, utterly amazed, halfway down, the sight of Cody and Bari
Johnson furying in the road (almost getting killed too), saying out loud
 My goodness gracious what is this? ; same who in fact that afternoon,
atthe exact moment Cody was approaching Watson, sat in a grave of his
own in his overcoat in an empty unheated Saturday classroom of West
Denver High not a mile across town, his brow in his hand as blackboard
dustswam across October fires in the corner where the window-opening

was leaned, where it was still written in chalk from yesterday's class
{in American Lit.) When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom d, sat there
in a pretense of thinking for the benefit of any teachers and even kids

ngin the hall with someof whom just before he'd in fact been joking
{threw a feeble lopsided pass across the afternoon lawn as he hustled
from Studebaker to business), sat now moveless in a pretense of remem-
bering, with severe precision, the exact date of something that was bot-
denecking his entire day, left wrist raised for a quick look at how much
time was left, frown of accompaniment already formed, drawer pulled
with letterheaded memo paper ready to fly the instant he smacked the
desk deciding, but actually choking over loss, choking over loss, thinking
ofthe love, the love, the love he missed when his face was thin and fresh,
hopes were pure. O growing old! O haggard ugly ghoul is life's decay!
Started life a sweet child believing everything beneath his father's roof;
went from that, immersed and fooled, to that mask of disgusted flesh
galled a face but not the face that love had hoped for and to that sou! of
ggruesome grieving ghost that now goes shuddering through nightmare
fife cluttering up the earth as it dies. Ah but well, Earl Johnson wanted
te throw a pass to Cody and Cody challenged him and said  Run with
the ball and let's see if I tackle you before you reach that Studebsker
 where the man s standing ; and Johnson laughed because he had been
{absolutely) the outstanding runner everywhere (schools, camps, pic-
 nics), at fifteen could do the hundred in 10:9, track star speed; 90 took
 off not quite realizing what he'd done here giving Cody these psycholog-
ical opportunities and looking back at him with taunts  Well come on,
tome on, what's the matter?  And so that Cody furiously, as if running
for his life, notonly caught up with him buteven when Johnson increased
his speed in wholchearted realizing race caught up with him easily, In
his sheer excitement, with his tremendous unprecedented raw athletic
 power he could run the hundred in almost ten flat (actually and no lie),
and a sad, remote tackle took place in the field, for a moment everybody
saw Cody flyingtackling horizontally in the dark air with his neck bulled
on to prove, his head down almost the way a dead man bows his head
self-satisfied and life-accomplished but also as if he was chuckling up
his coat sleeve at Johnson about-to-be-smeared, both arms outstretched,

wobbling pass that dropped beyond the kid s most radical estimate,
pass being so high and powerful the boy completely lost it in
spaces of heaven and dusk and circled foolishly but screaming
glee when this happened everyone was amazed except Johnson,
rushed outof the car in his sharp blue suit, leaped around frantically in,
mixup of kids, got the ball (at one point fell flat because of his new shi
bottom shoes that hadonly a half hour s poolroom dust on  em) and
manded the same uncomplaining noble boy to run across the field a:
enragedly unfurled a long pass but Cody appeared out of nowhere in

Cody and I are continually interested in the pictures of women s
 little black and white books nudged among many in a Times Square:

the whiter, the background all the darker and evil

Ruth Maytime (the famous Hollywood actress) and Ella Wynn and
love it  what tremendous lovely tits Ruth has, one shoulder strap of h

posters set on top of low graveled roofs of bowling alleys and shining
fiercely against the bare bald backs of windowless warehouses, or may-
be filling the windowed eyes of a hotel with their sheens, the glitter and
yet the hidden beyondish gloom of this drove Cody in his secretest mind
as it has myself and most others to further penetrations into the inte-
rior streets, the canyons, the ways, 0 much like the direction music
takes in the mind or even the undiscoverable flow of dream images that
make dreaming a tragic mystery; and so seeking rushing all dreams
into the heart of it, always the redbrick wail behind red neons, wait-
ing. Something was there that Cody and I saw together in an alley in
Chicago years later, when we parked a Cadillac limousine in an uno}
trusive black corner, pointed it to the street; that Cody saw a thousand
times in the walls of towns of Iowa, Virginia, or the San Joaquin Val
ley; something, too, that was namelesaly related in his poor tortured
consciousness to the part of the redbrick wall he had always seen from
the smooth old waitingroom bench of the County Jail when his father
had been arrested for drunkenness on Larimer Street probably with
five or six others taken en masse from a warehouse ramp, waiting for
his appearance before the judge to appeal to the court for some mete o|
mercy for his father, swearing he hadn't drunk for a month before and
soon making great childly speeches that sometimes astonished peo-
ple and later was brought to the attention of juvenile authorities w!
come looking to ald Cody like the Beast to aid the Beauty: the brickwall,
always dully glowing from dark red to gray bleak red as a neon some-
where flashed, seen through a ttle barred window on the inside wall
and where calendars depicting Indian maids in the moonlight wi
beads and exposed breasts drove Cody to wonder about the world thai
spoke of beautiful piney islands and Indian love calls and Jeannette
MacDonald yet had nothing to show for it but jailhouses, arrested fa-
thers, distant meanings, clocks tocking, and the one spike-driven sor-
row of that red wall besmirched with lights that were intended for the
streets for official passersby, but hid something behind for some sad_
and dishonest reason faintly related to what his father sometimes com-
plained about; and yet had the ability like any old brickwall of a fac:
tory if you put a white unloading light on it instead of red of shining
forlorn as brown snow.

Reaching into his pocket with that gesture, the topcoat flying
hind him, see Cody hurrying into the heart of Denver with the sam
gleam in his eye you see on the fenders of shiny new automobiles
dusted out of that old houselight reflecting garage but now wink
the wild neon of Main Strest; see him, sometimes in such a big hurry
that {t seemed the traffic light clicked green just for him and which
ever buddy arm-in-arm with heads knocking in talk he sweeps along

where sometimes the hour is so roaring that with the Tremont par-
backdoor open you can see a solid block of poolhall through the two

tling to stab the heart of the night or be stabbed but always missing

walls lead further, glowing from blackracked neons into unspeak-
secret glittering centers where everything must be happening or
least give modified indication of where to go for it, show down what

sending an aura of invitation and calling men to come and make their

etles against summer screendoors, against sad refinements and ex-
 gitements in the huge dark of America, umalum, umalum), and instead
whole night and everything it'll ever give anybody besides death
absolute loss is to be found twelve, thirteen feet above Cody's head
herushes all eyes into the poolhall, either with Watson the big Virgil
 the Poolhall Night with whom he shares the same robe of refined dis-
ted excitement everyone else's dumb about, the shark and his boy,
estars of loungey interviews at midnight, like Miles and Lee Konitz
gutting into a bar together, or, say, Ike and Harry Truman, or me and
y boy into the union hall three thousand miles from home, or alone
inkering; twelve, thirteen feet up the redbrick wall and barely around

(1431)
JACK. Then I remembered this,  demurely downward look 

CODY. I seem to remember that myself

 JACK. Although it wasn t really

CODY. No

JACK. It was my idea

DY. Yeah

|ACK. About the look you had

DY. Well yeah... it was kinda of a 

JACK. Butit apparently wasn't. . . what you were really doing. . .
CODY. That's what it really amounts to, though

JACK. Why, because lookit. . . the talkis far way from demure...
CODY. Well, thereasonforthedemureis. . .any approach to the words
, a8 | remember like what I said. . . here, ah,  I can t get it down, 
example, you know,  I can t get it down    Well, I approached that

terribly, I was talking you know about something you know, that  
 goin on  You know what I'm trying to say?

JACK. Hey? (suspiciously)

n, there'd be an ambiguity of . . . of, ah, ulterial mo
pater Ace know,  cause you'd bein the process of getting mea
under the machine and I'd be in the process of, ah, saying, like
examply, the reading of the manuscript, see, wal, hmm, wait a min
1 lost it (laughing)

JACK. Oh that

CODY. No that's just pencil  Hee hee hee, danin .
JACK. See, did you dig this here? I didn t notice that till I played it b
CODY. (after long silence). . . (laughing) . . . It's like last night.
dama thing :
JACK. Hmm boy that was good. That was a good one wasn't It?
CODY. Phew!

JACK. Hmm ...  And I remembered June's story about the
question mark? (reading) Yoohee, it s like a line of poetry. Is that
you said,  bad order high ?

CODY. Yeah, meaning, no good

JACK. I put that in

CODY. Yeah CODY. See? Here's what I m saying, for example, I say, now man,  can t
JACK. But I didn t know that when I put it in it down,  you know, and even as I say it it sounds awful, then also it
CODY. Yeah ands like struggling to get it down, and also sounds like whatever ap-
JACK. Now go on proach a young kid would, ah, approach with definite talk of getting it

_ down, or in other words it might be an idealist who is no longer idealis-
, and so he no longer wants to talk about ideals, y'know, and he doean t
tto, you understand what I'm sayin though don t you. . . . And, so 

CODY. Bad order, with his bad order not high but eyes . . . see, be :
bad order eyes, he can t see, that s what I m telling you, see

JACK. Oh yeah? t s what I say when I say  can't get it down,  and then. . .  two min-
CODY Ly tes SE Sr cacti ee ce
JACK. Oh bad order high  hat you said. . .and so the demure downward look. . . was simply in
CODY. Bad order  same tone and the same fashion. . . as my reaction and feeling was
JACK. Eyes when ! said the words  but you can t get it down  you know

CODY.  eyes, yeah JACK. Ah. . . you were demure when you were saying those words
JACK. Aaaah CODY.No,I said this 

CODY. His eyes are no good, see

JACK. | thought you were saying he was bad order high
CODY. Yeah

JACK. Okay

CODY. Same thing though, it is here

JACK. That son of a bitch. (Cody laughs) Look at that sonofabitch
CODY. Yeah

(132)

JACK. | don t know why you were demure if you were demure

Y. I was demure simply because of the same reaction of those
rds,  cause you chose  I can t get it down,  and I approached it with a
hesitancy, you understand what I m sayin? What I m saying is  

K. I thought you were bein demure because when I said  You don t
to get itdown ...

(133)
d down three hundred times like that you know
pile lke you're always supposed to be doing something
JACK. (interrupting) Oh if I really wanted to find it I'dtake them all
and stack  em up
CODY. Yeah?

JACK. No, I'd go one by one but it s not there

CODY. Yeah

JACK. Where is it?

CODY. What did you do with it, you played it three hours ago,

JACK. This thing here when Bull is sittin on the porch with his rifle a-
gross his knees? Now where is that?

CODY. Yeah, yeah, well it s back there... .
JACK. Wherever it is  course I know where it is at that moment 
m

CODY. What are you doing? I know where it is I say here 

JACK. Where is it? .

CODY. Right here,  settin with his rifle  cross his knees , . .

K. Yah. Now see these big questions . . .  yeah, I was there, yeah 
ber? Hee hee. So it s a mysh-tery . . . where could it have gone? say Why did he shoot?  Cody  "'He didn t stick it out the window,
wouldn t have unconsciously put it in an album? But since you'ven qwasall sittingon the porch    the moment you said that I feel the out-
theleas   of Texas

JACK. No ! didn t do that DY. Yah
CODY. None theless I'll do something like this, watch, I'll just pull
outand I bet it's Billie Holliday just to be vain, see? Now I haven't lo
at it you can tell, have I and certainly I don t intend to look at it;
just trying to put this plug in, see, I've been watching with my eyes,
youcan see I'm not cheatin and lookin. Awright. See. . . damn thing
ah I know, it's too loose. Now I hope I I hope it s Billie Holliday (
laughing) Huh? After you made three hundred motions. . .
JACK. You don't even know what it is

CODY. No. . . ready? Wait till the volume gets a little loud. Because
best part about Holliday records  for example you know that
There Eyes  (sings it, the riffintro, with little Texas upflip) And then,
know after they do that twice, three times really, why then she
singing . . . but you know that opening? Remember the opening 
first eight bars? Ready? Billie Holliday . . . (MUSIC starts). I
know the name of it

JACK.  Good Morning Heartaches 

CODY.  Good Morning Heartaches,  yeah. (laughing) Good mo
heartaches! .

BILLIE SINGING: Good morning heartaches . . .

JACK. What do you think of that?

BILLIE SINGING: . . . you old gloomy sight . . .

CODY. Man, she just sits there . . .

BILLIE SINGING: . . . good morning heartaches . . .

JACK. Wow

BILLIE SINGING: . . . thought we said goodbye last night. . .
(136)

KCK. Huck is playing his Billie Holliday, see, right here, naturally the
 s pointing to that part of the porch, and that Huck pleys Billie Hol-
y outdoors in the middle of Texas is see,  And Bull's sittin there
the porch with his rifle  cross his knees  . . . as that is playing in Texas
PY. Yeah, yeah, now you're talking

Sittin there like this, and where  I m sittin there,  and that's the
it -see, then  C-R-O-W-S-HI 

DY. Yah that was crazy

.  Adead tree strunk, he thought, see, for kicks, he'd shoot the tree-
k see?  (reading on to  baby cries )

DY. (laughing) See,  it hit the treetrunk awright  . . .

K. See,  Billie Holliday   

DY. Oh. Yeahman. . . .Now here's somethin you won't believe. Now
 ssomethin  / m gonna tell you somethin you really won't believe,
I'm gonna lay something down to you and you've got to really think
it in the same sense like we talked about  I can't get it down  or
thin, see? But not about that subject, but you got to understand the
ning of the words and soon. Just as I can talk there for twenty min-
about the reaction that made me give the demure downward look or
feeling of the  I can't get it down  you understand, in the same sense
those phrases you must understand that at the moment that I said
words  sitting on the porch  I chose those and thought of those be-
sel had the same reaction of the outdoors of feeling like the outdoors,
was the very word in fact it was the very reason that ] began to
ak. . . because you said you know often, I don t even answer. . .
ed tape, talking about Jack saying Bull Hubbard shot  out the

(137)
window ). . .and then I said  Yeah, I was there  and I just lifted
mind up and said that ~ had to say that for another reason, which! d
want to tell you, man~ what I'm sayin, is the reason I don t want tet
you is  cause it was a reason which   what I'M sayin, what it really
was, with the tape record, you know, well I said  Yeah I was th
ordinarily (Jack laughs) 1 wouldn't have picked up on that and ta
about it see, you know, but the fact that we are recording . . . so it w
kind of a lifting yourself up to say  Yah ! was there.  Now then, ah.  
about two three seconds later and when you said they were inside t]
window immediately my mind visualized that window as impo
you know, it was, window, he couldn't have shot out a window unless
was trying to sniper, you know, it was like this, the windows were
you know what I m sayin, and, so, but. . . sittingon the porch so, be:
we were always sittin on the porch and the porch where we were si
it s all an open front porch long and everything, and that, and wh
said  sitting on the porch  I thought that would show that it was
doors. . .justlike you say. . . and then, ah, but instead, my mind t!
got hungup on the fact that he couldn t shoot through the. . . porch
becauseit was screened in, so Bull actually was sitting on the front s
is where he was sitting! Because the whole thing was screened except
door, yeah, and he's sittin down there on the front ateps   but it seem:
me he was ina chair... .

JACK, Where's this thing play, inside the screen?
CODY. Off in the corner yeah inside the screen, yeah

  What would Irwin be doing?

 copy. Oh he left, he was only there three days, I never told you the great
ory of the bed, about you must have heard about it though, the bed,
symbolic bed? that Irwin and I were gonna build man? I didn t teil
about that story? man I got to tell you about that story. You mean .
 we've only played this once? (at phonograph)

_JACK. No, you played it twice

ODY.  You played it twice  (repeating)

Yeah. Well. Play a little  little blue eyes there  dem there eyes
ODY. This isn't blue eyes

JACK. Dem dere eyes (swiftly)

| (MUSIC STARTS)

 CODY. Hee hee hee. And the needle. This is the way it was in Texas, the
needle s ruined, see, and this kinda music, and of course Bull would say
 Play some Viennese waltzes  and Huck d have to play  em, Bull was
deadly serious man...

JACK. About the Viennese waltzes?

CODY. Yes!  cause Huck'd say  Aw man, you don t wanta hear Viennese

waltzes," and he d say,  Oh, I really do   and he wasn t just making an

JACK. On the porch or in the house? Scape reer ements sonal a tensions ets arta
: , Degun, it  Naturally t the guy was just kiddin,  but

CODY. Yeah and I'm sittin, on a bench I'm sitting on a Somerset  

type Beich all by niysetl, aad Huck's  mapa  and he asked it, so every afternoon he'd play Viennese

JACK. Yeah. Where were the washtubs? JACK. Of course Bull insisted

CODY. The washtubs were on the other side of the porch   where J Y. i 5 _
is, she's over there in the washtubs. And Huck s kneelin down and Go set apo machine tatrey ond ote eee en
* a small chair by the phonograph record to keep the music goin all scratchy, and it was Viennese waltzes comin out real awful, you know
me fea tinny phonograph, and here in this and it was sunlight, and hot
JACK. What's he sayin? man, out in the this outdoors, just like we was saying man, it was 
CODY. Yeah. Nothin. He's just sittin there (laughing), he was you understand, that music was comin out there, like'l d go outside and
blastin, that sall. . . he'll pass it to me and I'll pass it to him, and take a piss or something and I could just hear a little bit of this noise you
just sittin there like that, we weren t talking about nothing ever know, comin off this porch, see, way down in this Texas place (ail
. . .but I mean be was, onceina while he'd talk, you know, when we wi king), realcrazy . . .'Cause it was so hot all the time, it really wasn t
alonedriving together we'd talk, just about Hke we are now see. But Hi . outdoors or anything   but what I m tryin to say is that Irwin got. . .
at thet time was very worried and hungup kind of guy, you know, hev after now the understanding that Irwin and I had was not any 
living under a lot of pressure, he really was, see, you understand,  coming back to understanding about anything, but we were just we'd
buthe and I dug each other all the time real fine, everything real smoo  been high together all of three days, see we'd been together and we both
But  -wereatill young enough that we would talk and talk and talkevery minute

(138) (139)
just, you understand what the person means  cause he said that bef:
somethin   something like he'll say  Like what I'm sayin soand so

I really mean is this  and so the guy ll understand either because y

tell him or either because he picks up on the way that what you
about something when you tell it before like that somethi
other, why, he'll keep building up so then (/aughing) around a p

And so we was real high just before we got there  cause we made a k
twelve-hundred, thirteen-hundred-mile trip pretty successfully see,

could have been hungup, we were hungup one more day just goii
where, but at any rate now I'm sayin so we're gonna have this

big bed, see? that we were going to  but it was gone, I haven't even

you about it 
JACK. Yes, with cots or somethin

CODY. Listen to this, I'd never seen Bull or nothing, see, I never

met any of these people, see, so Bull s puttin on a big show, you

gettin his kicks you know, and Huck is saying  Glad to meet you

everything man,  you understand, think of that now, see. And so
we'reouton porch the first day and Irwin his only concern was bu

this bed for where we was gonna sleep that night. . . and there was
cots, see, and that was what we were going to sleep on, but Huck
Irwin had the big idea to join the two cots, and that entitled a great
of work, you see they were Army cots securely stapled together, and
to break all that, and pull all the front whole side of both of the cots,

then put them together . . . by terrible, Aard, see. . . . Well for

days be and Huck worked on that . . . in the front yard, you unders!
see? And... Huck was very queer about the whole thing, see, he

happy and queer . . . you know what I'm sayin, he was eggin I

and Irwin asked.me seriously, and I sald  I don t care, brrp, brrp 
know (laughing), when  and that was the reason that he went to D
see, because the bed was not a success (laughter). Yes. Soon as we
in bed together  Oh it never did get built and so finally we had te

what we did,  cause we couldn't get it together, we collapsed the

end of both of the cots and just slept on the floor (laughing), two co!

the floor, with scorpions, man, so it scared the hell out of you, see,

only that far off the floor, and, ah, man, that was kinda of a drag, so,  

I'm saying  but no kidding Jack, now this is of course, now you
I m no  I'm usually not talking about  you understand that I'm
I'm not even lookin, at what it was. . -

JACK. Oh yeah yeah
(140)

see and naturally it builds up a big lot of structure that s private that
build on the way down, and Is just an interchange of different ideas 4}
you have and different feelings but not about concretely or anything, |

DY. See? I started to look but I didn t, in the same sense of kicks, see,
don't know whatitis, see, so, here we go (Jack laughs)

(MUSIC STARTS)

Viennese waltzes!
Y. (laughs) Yeah
|ACK. That s what Bull insisted on, huh?
Y . Yes

(MUSIC:  Stay With the Happy People )
 ODY. That's right! (like Frank Morgan, enthusiasm) (laughing) Now
hat I m saying is (laughing). . .The bed didn t work, but what I m say-
is just a continue the continuity, 1 got so I couldn't stand Irwin to
touch me, you know, see, only touch me, it was terrible. Andman, I'd
r been that way, you know, but, man he wasall opening up and I was
s]  but what I'm sayin is that, ah so he was going to take a ship, in
Houston, and I got high on Nembutals, so I go out, I pick up a girl, in the
jeep. while Huck s down digging the cats in the corner saloon with his
stuff, see, and Irwin's waiting up in the room, so I come back with the
girl... and a quarter-of-a-block, no a half-a-block but quarter-block
y | was perfectly in. . .capacity of my senses driving along and...

Nembutals hit mel Bam! Man they hit me just like that, and 1 couldn't
quite reach the curb, I was completely (/aughing) in norm  control, but
ight in front of the hotel see, and I've just swung a right-hand turn
ind the corner  and it hit me man. . . and it was all I could do to hit
thecurb, and I looked at the curb, and I banged into it, really, I parked too
_ close is what I did, scraped  but I managed to but I was in a no-park-
zone right in front of the hotel see  cause ordinarily I wouldn t do
that you know, I would have parked it someplace else, but, and I conked
 outlike that, see, but I was still kinda, little bit,  cause I so 1, seems to
that we sat there. . . the girl was anidiot...

i?

DY. She was, she. . . told me that she was an idiot, and since she had
 they picked her up the next morning   Yeah, she'd be in an insti-
tution, and, ah, they picked her up periodically every three or four
ths, and put her away, she'd get out after awhile, because she was
ess. But what I'm saying is that, she drug me up the stairs, to Ir-
in's room, and we got and she went in bed with me and I tried to
_ Screw her and everything and I managed to finally even though I was so

...Manandeverything. . . but nothing else happened  cause Irwin
Kicked her out, see, and, so then I (laughing). . . owf

r

CODY. Now this is one time, now, see at exactly, all this I told yor s, I'd have continued reading, I wouldn't have talked, except you
which was really nowhere or nothin, just like the bed, see, just the, 11 datmeto...#0.. .] thought!'d better, so] wouldn t get hungup
thing, that is just because I said these words  I remember certain thin used toon tea, see, get hungup and not remember what I was going
. . . 80 I decided to tell you about one of  em, and it just came into m next, or not even finish the sentence because the effort to go back
mind, see. . . about this, see, awright? Awright? And now look, see, i remember in detail all those things that I've thought about earlier, is
never been, there s no meaning here   now J meanit'sa, a  ch  task, and unworthy, and it wasn't exhilaration, for the thing to
, .  it like you go into something the first time you see after a certain
JACK. You know what you're doing there don't you? Jol dees: roughly, about tour, fivegearvage after got hangup with
CODY. The continuity --Oh I know it's  a, why, since then there's no more spontaneous, there's no more,
JACK. Now, er really? . first happenings any more, you know what I'm sayin, which are
CODY. Ab hum, I know exactly what I'm doing man. . . I it s just

ngs that are to be thought about, or things that are, you know, there's
ing (laughing). . . . You understand anyway, yeah I mean
skin if he knows how to blow the horn see, you know, like if opening yway, y
en iaitacmnethinl vecognice that Slim thinks chat Iwas blowin 're just, ah, going along, see, and so, it's hardly worth it (/aughs)
you know, and J always blow like that see. . . and everything. . . . . What's worth it?
when a man does somethin on a horn he wonders if someone else
hears him, like oft times! used to think about,  Did Jack hear that?  oral   veer ok. couple of years ago hardly worth it to complete
somethin about a particular record a long time ago or somethin like sr t got so try as I might I couldn't and it developed
see. . . . But what I'm sayin is that, I say, well of course he does man, news that way, see, so now in place of that I just complete the
knows more aboutitthan Ido, he knows about that, you know, he kno homers peraner you re like! are areal ara
about, you know, see, (laughing) and so that s the same way that v  es, trying to make myself hurry back to where

. -< ; 0 id be here, and also. . . and only indications that lead me to goon
I'msayin, [know  but, 80 J have to tell him, I m just sayin, those gray like, foal Wookling atwiGa ony that Galy ui UMC aay aig

(148)

sember certain things led me to think of all this, here, which wasn't
here, as I said, it s just like even now, as I told in the story about the
... 1 didn t really feel it was anywhere but it wasn t ay-thing, In
it was  whatitactually was, was recalling right now on my part, a
ing of me having either told about or thought about the bed con-
before, see, a0 therefore I, all I did now was re  go back to that
mory and bring up a little rehash of, ah, pertinent things, as far as !
remember, in little structure line, a skeletonized thing of the--what
ughtearlier, and that's whatonedoes you know, you know when you
pack and remember about a thing that you clearly thought out and
nt around before, you know what I m sayin, the second or third or
rth time you tell about it or say anything like that why it comes out
ferent and it becomes more and more modified until it becomes any
ie thing that you say, see, like for example, I can remember walking
from schoo! when I was seven years old, you underatand, and I'd
y had such a long sex life and it was a0 involved that all one
ter, every day, me and this little Mexican kid didn t talk about any-
else and ! simply told him all about what had happened to me since
thing, but you looked at meand so that I go on talking abour these  
thinking about things, and memory,  cause we're both concerned
ah, memory, and just relax like Proust and oon Sol talkon
remem thinks and that s why it s di
for tel Yeah otaeee soi so that s, but it's not pa a CODY.  you know. We've got to break loose out of that man (meaning
because you can get hungup if you don t know when sharply to
knife, see, and switch back to something, you know, or somethi
cause it becomes a hangup or just meaningless talk, you know wh
sayin, see, so that that s hard, you know, as | continue, see, b
really I don t like this! The same feeling, right here, see, as I rem
telling that last night . . . I don t like it, same feeling that 1 had
gets you down,  not that I had the feeling when I read it, but
contrary that s the words that produced it, you understand, ket y
through earller, on previous. . . . Same way here I keep having
going back to this because I m not. . . I don t, you understand (la
feel it, proud of it, or anything, you understand, see, and so it s ha
hard tocome back to this particular, see, sol've been postponing it
see? (both laughing) Turrible thing. Now this one time, really,
what I mean here, see, same thing,  Huck, you remember how
you see,  New York kick,  so,  Huck said  Come on man I want tol
you something  he   and Irwin,  he and Irwin were that way a
deal, Irwin would say  You've got to see that piece of cloth,  Hu
sayin    (reading haltingly) . . . because see that's what happened,
and I m describin now, see, now here I'm going through the p
telling you, and you're the one who wrote it down, see, so I'm
know, you know more about it than / do 

JACK. I didn t punctuate it

CODY. No, you know more about it than ido. . . no well, it
punctuated talk anyhow. What I'm sayin  you know what J ms
the reason I'm hangin up right now, talkin this way is just in the
sense that ! want to tell you that rememberin certain things led ints
see, and I've already said that, by telling you about this and
don t want ta go back to it because of that, so now I'm... I'm
going on with thereading and still using the same process, I'm sayin;
so that means that up here Jack. Well that s not necessary now, '
passed through that, because now we're talking just about the very
that / thought about which was as I seid earlier a mo-difi
skeletonized form of one of the things I happened to remember d
Texas you know. . .. And so. . . yeah well pick out a new needle,
something you might find that would be  now listen I want to tell
something! You know I looked at the clock when Jimmy Low call
nineo clock . . . now it's quarter to ten, he said within the hour, see,

(146)

time and everything, and, we went through here for a minute,

ACK. Out of what! Out of this?
DY. Yeah. I gat to go, out there
CK. Working for nothin! (going to machine)

 . Whoa (Aolding him off), fatal. . . fatal. But what I'm sayin is, 1
to get hungup on my-self goin out there, and you gotta get hungup by
self here and that s a kind of a drag, man, you understand. I felt
Lionel when I said that,  That's a kindofadragman,  you know how,
Li'salwayssayin Oh that s adrag man," you know how he's always
yin that, y  know, sympathizin with you, you tefl him something, he
s  Man that must have been a drag!  man, or else he'll say  and it is
drag for when he's describin it himself  but so I got to do that man,
sorry, but we gotta get a renewal of the supply of the material which
makes it possible for us to be this way
'K. We'll save the reat for Jimmy

DY. Yeah!

-QODY. Well for crissakes, Jack, can t you make your piecrust a little
harder?( W. C. Fields-ing) (laughs alone as Jack types) Jesus Christ! See
Ithought of that line before I said the first one. . . that's why I said  for
crissakes,  1 thought of the .. . catchline, see? 1 gave it plenty of
weight, weighed it see then after I said it I thought  Gee, I waited too long,
be might think I had to think of that last line.  (Jack flutes) I thought of
the first line first, I mean the yes I guess I did after all, but the second
line] had before I finished the first three words of the first line, Ijuat. . .
waited too long. . .

JACK. That's it, boy, you come over here and tell me now
CODY. (/aughs) I'll tell you Jack, here s how I'll tell you--I think what
youshould do is ask questions, like for example-- phew! man I had ita

SUICIDE

CODY. Jesus Christ, whoo!

JACK. But instead of getting hungup there you notice I went on playin

CODY. Yeah

JACK. The next sentence is this: and it s better than what I was goin to
say: CHURCH MUSIC, THAT'S BEST, JUST LIKE ARTIE SHAW
SAID. We were playing church music on the flute . . .

CODY. Ah huh

JACK. . . . Artie Shaw, Billie Holliday record,  Gloomy Sunday,  the
suicide record of the Thirties .. .

CODY. Yeah

JACK. . . . youdidn t, did you, know that? about the record?
CODY. Ah huh

JACK. Did you connect Artie Shaw with it?

CODY. NO!

JACK. Is it interesting to connect Artie Shaw with that record?
CODY. Yes

JACK. Why? :
CODY. Wellman youdon texpect him to have thatinsideofhim. . . with

ail them cunts a man listen, a man that has as many cunts shouldn t
have anything else on his mind

JACK. About whet, cunt? ;
CODY. No, not thinking aboutcunt, heshouldn tbegrantedtheright. . .
to have any other kind of a thought except what lies between them little
gals legs. . . . Soif he'd aay a whole kind of stuff like that why, he'd get
scrupefied. Very interesting

JACK. That's what Artie Shaw said (reads, flutes) 1 KEEP FEELING
THAT EVERYBODY KEEPS PICKING ON ME (Cody laughs) NOT
ONLY CODY AND EVELYN BUT YOU TOO

(182)
DY. What

CK. What would be good to say, to write that, | suppose, you can
ite anything in there

CODY. Yeah

 JACK. ... something like that, that s the trouble with that

 . Yeah that s the trouble

JACK. But in fact that's what's good about it, you can write anything
in there. Huh?

Y. That s right. Has to be damn sharp though. Celine does a lot

minute ago, why didn t I blurt it out  Shit! The reason I didn t
out  cause you said  Now I m gonna write my next sentence,  so.
down thinking about you writing your next sentence, and I thou
myself  Now ifhecanask himself questions. . . that, that, ah, hel]
instinctly, whatitis about him that s that way,  why then you can m;
statement about it, like,  I m very decent,  only on a much better
like if he   Jesus Christ I'm trying to think of what \t was I thought

cerning... THE TAPE RECORDER IS TURNING, THE TYPEW)
ERIS WAITING, ANDISIT HERE WITH A FLUTE IN MY MO!
And so you're just sittin there thinking while it's playing (plays
flute) :
CODY. That's just what I've been doin but I couldn t think of t
thought, And I guess the reason I can t think of it and why I m
is because I didn t formalize it or 1 didn't think about it long eno
soon as the thought hit me, why, I didn t think it out, because I w
gonna blurt it out. Damn, if I'd have just spoken   (Cody running
at sink, flute blowing, watery flute) Your coffee s gettin cold. 1
itaver but I don t know which one it is (really meant, he says, he d
know whether I wanted cream or sugar or what)
JACK. See how terrible it is when no one listens

_ CODY. Oh man, yeah, I know how terrible it is. Christ yes
JACK. Why that s ~I'm going mad now, see every time I start soi
thing I go crazy. That's my next sentence. (pantomimes collapse
typewriter, falls on floor) See? What was it? About 
CODY.  Every time I start something I go crazy . . .
JACK, Ah... . (types) No, no, no, I didn t say that! What was I sz
in? About the coffee? :
CODY.  See how it is when nobody listens? 
JACK. Yeah, that s what I was sayin. That's not what I wanted to
CODY. No
JACK. No. . . . When you answer you're goofed. Don t goof here
CODY. Ab huh
JACK. Although that would be good to write wouldn't it now

(184)

JACK. What does he do?

 CODY. Ah you know how he writes...

JACK. Hedoes a lotof, ah, that, yeah... . Ithas to bedamn sharp

CODY. Yeah, damn right

JACK. How can I he eatingon Benzedrine? (eating at table)

CODY. (laughs) That tea tl overcome anything. (pause)... Why don t

youlet me read John s letter? (playing whiny little boy)

JACK. Didn't you read it?. . .

CODY. Now see, you know four times I asked you and four times you

didn t answer me sce, so at this time 1 said  Well   although I've hes-

{tated asking it several times, I thought  I'l make Jack say  Nah don t

_yead it   you know, and. . .  cause you never did say it, see. I kept ask-

ing and asking and you never answered . . . . You always give some

ambiguous statement or you never say anything at all like you just now

said  Didn't you read it?  S  if it was perfectly alright (laughing)...

Ewould have read it long ago if ['d known I could have read it

JACK. Oh. (Cody laughs) Well . . . the first page was written before
got high

CODY. Oh! know that, | remember exactly where you got high

JACK. And I feel very guilty about it

CODY. Oh I see, uh huh

JACK. Wellreadit.(pause). . .1 feel thatI'massailed fromall sides. . . .

'm being flailed from all sides

CODY. Jesus Christ, man, that s a terrible feeling . . . Jesus

JACK. But there's no time for feeling, huh?

CODY. Well there's time for feeling, it's just how much first thing
you would do with it you know, 1 mean, ah, I can t, ah... . It's very

(185)
hard, in the end we're all by ourselves . . . . So, got to figure out
selves. . . . But the thing is, what I don t know, I think your mind i
much on the writing so that you really don t have time to really sit d
and go into whatever this is that s flailing you, all these people ff , im  
you, and so that you're not really hungup on thet, it s just a feeling cet can't remember Leave Us Leap
you don t deal with, and so you, you know  cause you've got too n "AT.  Leave Us Leap ? Oh man it's sensational
other things on your mind. What it is with me would be a change ACK. Roy Eldridge on it?
personality. . . 1 mean a change in values, change in  - IAT.  one of the best numbers I ever heard. Doesn't tell you. Must
JACK, In what way?
CODY. Well you know, a change in your concerns, what you're
cerned about, See you're not really concerned about that or else y
think aboutit more and be hungup onit. You're hungup on it alright.
JACK. On . . . writing about iti
CODY. Yes, it's just because you're writing, see, you're really only
cerned about the writing . . -

(tape goes blank for four minutes while they go on talking, a
fame, not wanting to be destroyed, status, career, control, both of
extremely sad and close)

(CONTINUATION OF TAPE)

.. -that'll make some difference, but ah, I got a little better control
Tused to have but it s still not the right kind I guess
JACK, Well you're, you're a family man now... . You know, Jar
Joyce had a big family but, ah, well, | don t know how he got to
so much; he lived in Switzerland, Frence; he had his study, you kno
hewasaman of serious solemn habits, that s all, took walks in the
ing, and wrote, had a job as a teacher. He had alot of children but I
think he spent any time taking care of them, see, except once in a
an hour or soaday...
CODY. You're not gonna get hardly any of this recorded you know
JACK. Well, that s the sadness of it all

THE PARTY.

about you and him and Old Bull Lewis, Old Bull Balloon, and J cl
his nameto Old Bull Lewis because he was supposed to be a farmer,
a farm, outside of town, Alameda there, and I said  The three of e

got in thecar for some unknown   well they gota lot of, ah, wire t JACK. Oh my father had one, Model T Ford
and, and acreen, they got together, and they got a  they went DY. Yeah

Nebraska to sell these flyswatters, made these little flyswatters . .
car like a potato bug crawled eastward for no reason under the
skies"  all that kind of shit?

CODY. Andit s just what happened, see, | remember that trip
JACK. Carl Rappaport wasall hungupon the way that I had picked
the images, of what you told me about yourself, and projected t!
the wall, all ballooned up 

CODY. Enlarged, yeah

JACK. . . .and cracked, crazy, (Cody laughing) Old Bull Balloon,
Who was actually theguy?. . . that went with you...

CODY. Well, he was a guy either named Blackie or, ah, something
that, but he was a tough, muscular 

JACK, Listen. . . | hada guy called Rex . ..a bum, he was a bud
your father s, but I know there was no guy called Rex but do you
why I called him Rex?

CODY. No

JACK. I said  Because he was no king, he was a guy who never
to grow up and so an American who, ah, never, ah, outlived the d
grow up and so lay on the sidewalk   you know, like we all want to
down on the grass on the sidewalk, and there s a at one point yo
ther, Cody, see, Old Cody s  ~ he's ting under a pool of piss a
Rex, something, under the ramps .

CODY. (laughing bemused) I'veseen him lyingin many a place like
but this guy going to Nebraska was like I say tanned and muscular
... very eminent, he wasn t in the depths of alcohol like my father
though he was a complete wino and drank all day and everything,
was young, he was only about thirty or so, see- 

JACK. Oh yeah?

CODY. And yeah, hewasa younger man and he's theone whoo
the car, in fact my father could barely drive, see, Model T, an old
T, which was old at that time, see

 K. What year was that?

DY. 1 was nine years old, 20 that s   makes it 1935

(ACK. What year was it?

DY. Model T, the last one was built 1927, so that'd be earlier than

DY. Yeah, that's right, and, ah, so we went, and I remember all about
the trip and everything, but about this man I remember only that he I
 tadmire him in fact, of course I was with my father wholeheartedly,
d everything you know, of course, so I really didn't like the guy and of
urse finally the reason my father came to dislike him, because the guy
was really too   well he knew he had the upper hand, as far as that goes,
know, because he was, ah, independent young guy and everything,
and but ah, Ido remember one time on the trip, I remember lots of things
ut the trip but I just want to mention about this one guy, speaking of
her things . . . l remember one day I caught him taking a piss behind
  car or something, see, and he'd just woke up in the morning, you
know, and he had a big piss hard-on you know, and | was stupefied and
nocked out by the size of his cock, you know, see,  cause I was only nine,
 course, and noticing those things I guess more or less then but not in  
any way, but, just ] remember now distinctly in my mind what an
enormous penis he had, you see, and then the 

XK. There's a yeah, it frightened me 

CODY. Yeah. It wasn t  it was I was | felt a great deal of envy, just
like in this Neurotica that I just read here, castration complex, see

the whole thing is devoted to that and this and that

I remember, I was very . . . oh not frightened exactly or anything

CODY. (speaking from last month on unerased tape) . . . just irwin'sletter and you said  Here let me read this  and you read a line
ou d say  Well now here's what really happened  and you described
t June and Julien and everything, and I saw a lot of things in there
ah, she was getting more ah, you know, ah, I mean not that she could
become more extreme but I mean she was just more. . . capable
fpractically anything, huh? wasn t she. So, ah, and but the way she was
g herself go, you see, with her black teeth, and with her uncombed
all those things, huh? .. . huh? Well, what I m saying, If those
happen, why, maybe she probably would have died of some,
. ordinary disease, see, that would catch her, or maybe alcohol-
the liver or something, you know, that kind of death like my sister
of, May, she was twenty-four, see, and, drank and killed herself, in

CODY. No, that s all; well you know we'veonly got part of that one
that sall you got, yeah, you got an hour. So Finistra. . . killed hin
didn t do it deliberately, but at the same time, he was pushin
that way wasn't he, you know he was hungup with the idea, cow

thought about killing himself can'tyou, but at the same time whenit
down to the fact of doin it, he never did  er Street and he said  Come on boy, let's go together and batch
JACK. He didn t mean to kill himself her again like we used to,  and all that, I said  Well  
CODY.  and when hefinallydid hedid, yeah, so that shows the,   Where had you been before that?

school from eight until two-thirty and run a service station me
another fellow at least owned . . . jointly

JACK. In what school?

CODY.  ah East High, and ah, and ah, I ah, used torun the service
tion from two-thirty till seven and then the other partner came on, ran
five hours while I slept

JACK. What kind of gas?

CODY. Oh, ah, man, some off brand, ah, see some off brand (
laughs) ah, and then from midnight till eight we worked rec:
tires at Firestone, see, and I lived with Kriloff the Bulgarian at that ti
but instead of sleeping from seven to midnight, from seven at night
midnight, five hours, why I had a girl, couple girls, and so I was
out with girls instead, see, so I never got my rest so after six weeks I
. . apartcompletely, and gave up the gas station, and had to quit my
at Firestone, and quit school, and laid around doin something or
but I never laid in the sense that . . . we'd lay around or, people in
York lay around, I was doing something all the time, I never laid  
until after the poolhall, which was~

JACK. One of these days tell me about the poolhall 

CODY. The poolhall was much different. I really can t approach that
 cause I don t know anything about it...

JACK. So you met your father on Larimer Street

CODY. Hesaid, ah, Comeon let's batch together  I said:  What you g
in mind?  he said  Well, ah, they're building a construction camp, they

So, semi-against his wishes and partially not, why, I told him that I was
going to go to L.A., and ah, managed to have just enough money  now
that he had his job he wasn't so he gave me all his money, and I got a
bus and went to L.A. from Provo on

JACK. He gave you all his money

CODY. Yeah, well he had capital, I meanit wasn t froze, so, as far as that
goes

JACK. What, wa, what was your what happened?

CODY. Well when I got to L.A. previously I had been in trouble
thereacouple times before, I'd get all involved talking about that and. . .
0 -

JACK. No! mean what happened when   with you and your father, per-
sonally? . . . going from Denver to Provo 

CODY. Well I can't remember much, it seems to me we'd sit and talk
on the bus, I was embarrassed by his stupidity and that people could
dig, you know, and perhaps by his appearance, and I remember it was
very cold and everything was awful because one of the buses broke
down 

JACK. He wrote in his letter about it

CODY. .. . Yeah, but, ah, at the same time already | was reminiscing
about him and thinking about him or concerned about him but I wasn t 
ah, really considerate and careful or anything of that nature, but at the
same time there was no outward, ah, there was no rupture ever or any-
thing of that nature, we'd never argued except, ah, over women that I was
building a great steel mill, Columbia Steel Mill, Provo, Utah, and ah, screwing and he was screwing, like Mrs. Blood, but, but there's no, ah,
they're startin to buildit and wecan goto work up there.  So he had s difficulty that way, except that {t was a drag to me, personally, see, be-
money, for achange. forty, fifty dollars so! said  Alright I'll go with you.  cause he s content just to lay up in a hotel room and get drunk and then
Provo, Utah, yeah, that s a big steel mill; very dead of winter, so we gotowork thosecight hoursaday he hasto. . . . It wasn't really anything
up there, it was just about Christmas time, and ah, so we went to P that I can talk about because ah, it was just a bus trip, I  member him
and ah he got his job of course and we got all ironed out, took us a day: reminiscing himself ab  alittle bit about the past, but he's always doing
two, so I was all hired and everything except inadvertently I said 1 itnow, whenever he s with me, he says  You remember the time boy that
seventeen, would be eighteen in a month, eee, February eighth, we did this, or that?  and | usually don't
know, my birthday the guy said  I'm sorry, can t work until you're JACK. You usually don't!?
teen,"'so, that wasa hangup; but, atthe same time, we went through & CODY. No! usually don't. . . . See, that s why I say, instead of sending
of other difficulties like, ah, well the inability to get liquor there, and this to Carl what I should d  cause this prol I
I saw that I d just be making runs for my father all the time, and thin; sno 0, see,  cause this prologue is all nothing
lke that t-they giveyousration varia it in Utah, _ know anyhow and it s not necessary or anything to begin with. . . what
;   See you got~- they give you a   & perm I m saying, if] could get him out here he could sit down, he could tell me,
nother states similar to that, | think Oregon is oneof  em, but at any hie could teil me, on this

i recorder he could tell me, see? all the different
so, why, ah, atthesame time by the time we got to Provol was all hot dhitins that }doa'tknow dad ha ides of
to get to L.A., see,  cause L.A. was my mecca then, and Id already 8 miknow a ve no tea of
out several times before, and so I couldn't resist you know what I meat JACK. But the things you remember he doesn't

(206)

CODY. Perhaps. . . yeah, oh course now his mind probably is so b

. Get him to Frisco
he. . . won't even remember Ge mn thee  .
JACK. We'll get out him Frisco, that s right, get him a little place down on

CODY. I'd like to, of course Evelyn . . . won't, but one, while 
JACK. Imagine, it's like getting my father out here! (cackling)
CODY. Yeah, that's what! aay, goddammit, that's what I say we've got
to do that, a while back 
JACK. While he's stil! alive 
CODY. Yeah, that s what I say; so finally she consented to say that,
 Well we could have him for a visit at least . . . or something,  so, that 
alright, so, we'll do it, that way, but ah, what worries me is the transpor-
tation plus the fact here is the point: Buckle s in Denver now, right
Buckleis there, he has a pass in his pocket that he s not using, remember
that hangup he's talking about the pass Henry Wunderdahl gave him?
over different railroads?  and so here he s got this pass that my old man.
could use, see, and at the same time even if he didn t use the pass Buckie
could bring him back with him, see? he could come back with Buckle,
even if it means layin out some cash somehow sce, but instead of that I
asked Evelyn today what Buckle s address is and where he is thers,
course / didn't ask him like a dope, and she didn t know either of course
so there we are, we don t know where Buckle is

JACK. We're gonna be high in another ten minutes. . . ten more minutes
kid

CODY. Oh it s funny   does this hit you, or not?
JACK. (mumbling) Yeah, it... sure...
CODY.  but at any rate 

JACK. --four grains of benny  

CODY.  that s the problem, how you gonna how you gonna get him
out here, that s the problem, we haven't got unless the obvious way to.
do it, how are you going to find Buckle? see? and tell   :
SACK. See when we're all working... .(CODY, Yeah)... we can very
well support that old guy!!
CODY. Yeah and hecan take care of the children, but of course Evelyn is:
worried about the kid ~because 

JACK. He can't because he s too drunk . . .
CODY. Yeah, well that s what I say. . .l know that but here's what I'm
sayin. . . Evelyn won't have him in the house if he s drunk, see. . . well
that s what I want to know, if he could control himself for awhile, we'd
have to see, we could get him a little place. . .

(208)

That's right 

, ~that's the thing to do, exactly the thing todo. . . . Alright, well
yi got to 

. Or 2 room, on Mission Street 

DY. Alright, how are we going to get him out here? we've got to get in
stact with Buckle, write to Buckle; now, we don t know where Buckle

that, ifah, we're going todoit, and that s the thing I think that s n
to do, especially since

COPY. I got it soft enough so we can hear even our smallest monos;

(212)

DY.  ] was talkingall the time continuously, philosophically, quest-
jonings and reasonings about certain things, statements about every-
thing, which I've completely forgotten now and yet the words I said
probably a million words, more, more than that, for three years
straight but 1 mean that was theend of it, there. . . but finally, I remem-
 ber, finally, near the end I can remember a certain thing, like, like I'd talk
for two hours and I was, ah, and everything was real crazy, real gone,
and finally the guy  one of the guys I was talking to, the cabdriver, he
said  Well that s all real good, and real fine, and real great, Cody, but ah,
t ah, you don't have any MONEY,  or somethin like that, he showed
ateverythingI said wasjustnothing, just wasn t right, but, that wasn t

(213)
the point. That's one thing I'll never be able to recall, all the things I
alithethings I speculated about, which were so  the way I did it, of
voice, or something, or at any rate so that, like I told you earlier p
ably, why, these friends of mine like, like Tom Watson, and other
around there, other guys  guys I've never . . . told you about, a
named Joe, ah, Joe--Gooley or somethin like that, not Gooley  e;
there s another kid named Gooley, but Joe somethin, but at any rate,
other boys they'd bring down whenever they'd meet a strange girl,
couldn't make it, they d bring her down to my house so I'd lay there
talktothem all night. . .get her on top . . . 80 they could screw her
all that. . . but I can't remember  see talkin about  
JACK. Talk about what?
CODY. Make as if he owned her!
JACK. Would that make the girls hot?
CODY. No!   because it was very. . . pedantic and, ah, very, ah, s
lative but I was you know, I d just stay there and talk about .
now for example, we know that I 
JACK. You had no cunt yourself?
CODY. Oh yeah, Lusually always did have cunt, always have, yeah,
fact, always have, always have had... yeah. . . but, ah, those were
the things I was meaning to talk about, but J do recall at that time t
was theendofit, finally got sosickof it, not that 1 was doing it artif
ly or nothing, you know, in fact | was completely hungup on it, but
I'll tell you exactly, you know what ended me? from that whole pe:
From the time that ] was fifteen till 1 was eighteen, or, nineteen
well, and 1 was hung in there completely, and I mean some real
way, why, ah, and I mean things to be proud of too, in fact things
see guys now hungup on that  which I have told you about someti
guy that s, see, who's, but at any rate, I won't now, but he's a brakem
that lost his jobafter two, three days because he he used to stand up
top of the boxcar, but that s not the reason he had an accident, but
not the point either. . . what happened is, that, ah, one day I was 
I had just got out of jail, I'd been in jail eleven months and ten days,
ah, Justin still loved me enough so that he got me a job, a good job
capping tires, a trade that | had learned earlier, three years earlier un
his auspices, and, workin at night and goin to school daytime and so
sol had a good job, anda. . . great cunt, atrtT hed everything alll li
up, ] was living . . . real fine, in fact, I was living real fine, see, and
was the boss of the joint after five o'clock because everyone went ho
and I wasaloneso that every night the boys would come down with
girls and we'd havea big beer bust anda ball, and Benzedrine too, but
rate, so ah, one day about five o'clock just when the place was clos

(214)

they have tire changes, you know, four or five of  em, three or four of  em
hanging tires all the time, course | didn t do that, I let them cap the tires
themselves, which is different, but at any rate, this blondheaded kid
there, he was bendin over changin tires, and finally he got up, and I hap-
to be standin there watchin him for a second or somethin, and he
said,  Say,  he said,  isn t your name, ah, Cody Pomer " 1 said  Yes. 
He said  Well my name is Val Hayes, and ah, and ah, Justin Mannerly, |
think we have mutual friends, Justin Mannerly.  I said  OH! Val Hayes!!
Yeah I heard about you, yeah, you've got such a great brain and every-
thing  and he said  Well,  and all that, and he came on very . . . cool; at
_ pny rate but I popped right on him right away and hung to him, 80 much
eoin fact that he came back 

JACK. You what to him?

CODY. Hung to him, you know, so, so much so that he came back after
be went home to eat supper ~ but Val has always been, as he still is now,
_gnly of course more so, so that we never see him or hear from him, he's
always been very  Well now I, I'm sorry but I've got to godo this, and go
do that, and so I can t,  but, ah, that night, that first night of meeting
he said, ah  Well I do have to go home and eat supper, however I'll come
back around seven, seven thirty or eight, see I'l g  and we'll talk,  I
seid  Fine,  so he went and he came back, and, so I closed up shop, and
we went over and ate, toeat supper   usually I ate my lunch or something
 but I closed up the joint and we went over to a cafe and sat there and
talked and everything, and sh, so, that very first night if I'm not mistaken
 orvery close to the first time ever met him why, ah, I was startin to come
on one way or another and like I said  Well Val, course I think the moet
important men in the world, the most important thing in the world of
course and the thing that really counts of course is philosophy,  and he
said:  Oh, why no, it s, ah, to me I should think that the. . . poet is much
more important than the philosopher.  I said  What?  and I was so
stupefied and astounded and nullified and disturbed that anyone could
honestly believe that, that I, well I yox know, I really was, ah, upset
about it, and ah, went into it but of course by this time I had rehashed
all my thoughts completely and extended the limits of my thoughts in
every direction so much so that everything as I was telling you ab  ah,
last night when I was telling you about the skeletonized form? and about

. .theremembrance, see? like if you tell mey   ah, or have gone through
athing completely in your own mind yourself, ah, and so that you've got
it all formulated, and eo that sometime a guy'l!l say  Hey, when's the
first time you met Val?  well you say  Oh well I was walking down the
street and that s how it happened,  well, and so you say it three or four
times, so pretty soon, especially if it's a thought, not a happening, but a
thought, so if you have to go through a thought again and again pretty

(213)
girl," and which wasmy. . -girl,and atthe same time!'ll pick up on
hin else that I ran into theother day, a fifteen-year-old girl, so ah, he
Fine  so I said  Alright I'll come around your house about five
in the morning,  this girl has to get out early  cause for. . . some
or other so I picked her up, went to his house, and at that time
rent trucks from Hertz system, it only cost two bucks a day, see,
 d disconnect the speedometer, that's why   &
From who?

Y. Hertz. . . system, drive yourself system, trucks, and, ah, Hertz,
h, yeah, H-e-r-t-e-s, ah, z and, ah, so I'd get a panel truck, panel, you

enclosed?.. .small. . .drive. . . pickup, only it's not a pickupit's
, but I put a mattress in the back, see, Kriloff s mattress, see, I'd
off the, ah, and throw blankets in there, see, so then I'd pick up the
Je and we'd take off to the mountains, where I had a cabin up there
iowasa. . . friendof, well the cabin belonged to a friend of Jim Bvana,
at any rate, 20, we 
JACK. I knew Jim Evans

Y. Yeah I know that you do know . . . him, that's why I mentioned
but, ah, so we went up there, and we had our kicks all day man, and I
my. . . kicks then were driving kicks, see my  here s, here're what
do, I'd go pick up two or three or whatever I had, a couple or, one, or
person or no persons, and drive  em up to the cabin, then I'd. . . take

soon it becomes an abstraction of the thought and you still follow
form and structure of it but you just say  Well so this happened and  
happened,  andit becomes justa dry, drab nothing, you see? It s not
it was at first. Soat any rate, h, I had that disadvantage you see,  cause
Iwasrightat thetailendofmy whole. . . school ofall that, and the whe
system that I was concerned about and everything that was my-self and
socompletely wrapped up in-to that that I really hed nothing with which
to answer him because everything I said course I could think of
thousand things and comeupwith'em all the time but, but it was just...
statements, period, this and that you see, without the without all the
things thatare between that build it up intoa solid building, like you can t
make it out of just bricks, but, so, at any rate, after Val said that and, ah,
what, by golly after, ah, three fourdays andalso  probably, Idon'treally
want care to speculate to say why, that the reason came about, but
suddenly I realized that the philosopher was not that the poet was
more important than the philosopher, you see 
JACK. Course!

CODY.  andah wellofcourse now! (and laughs)  that I understood
immediately and completely, but you see, actually what it means then
that I musthave lived ina very   well I did of courselive in a very strange,
frantic world th 1, ah, I'd go sit in the library and get all hungup
those things, just completely involved trying to find what it was, or w
ever it happened to be, but at any rate that was .. . my whole life toff and go back to town, pick up some more, by that time
everything, ah, so much so that I developed a great smugness and com- had to go home from the cabin o I'd take cheek home, canewiantl
placency and a, ab--'course I was never a snobor anything of that nature, sce, thirty-five miles, just back and forth, back and forth, gettin my
really, except perhaps the way that I happened, or might be, not that off that way, see?  at the same time bangin and everything (socking
concerns meatall but I m just saying that  that s how I met Val. . . ms) and having my kicks, but, sol did that that day of course, see, and
that summer was real great because, about three or four days later why _finally it got so involved that, that Val had to go home by himself, s0 1
happened to remem  see I don't remember now of course absolutely.  stayed there for another reason and, and soah, he didn t get back till after
this or that happening or this or that happening, but I do remember is. midnight, see, and we spent the night up there just he and I layin there
_ . .all days that we had together, and other nights, and but ! would talkin and everything, and then at any rate, ah, it finally became so that,
just. . . briefly without going into a lot of things like, ah, like ah, well like ah, | would meet him, ah, every . . . night around suppertime, er, no, I
one morning, see, he would do things that he wouldn 'tordinarily do, now, would meet him whenever he was free, like say Saturday noon or some-
Iseehe wouldn't, you see, so that I got him up at five a.m., ab, got this girl thing, and we'dgotothe. . . bar, directly across the street, fifty yards, ah,
for him, who was my girl you see, but of course she waa so great and so from his house, we would sit there and drink beer   you know that little
gone and everything, besides at that time I'd never known what such s bar, the Marion Inn 

thing ima  I couldn t possible imagine such a thing as jealousy, or any- JACK. Marion Street

thing, couldn't possibly be concerned with the fact that, ah, anything of :
CODY. Yeah Marion, that s right, the little bar up there at Park, Seven-

that na  like I say, but, so, therefore naturally I was always making @ .
girl and turning  em over to my other boyfriends, I did that with several _feenth and Marion, Park Avenue also, it's a three-way intersection
JACK. I know that bar

girls but all this is all nothing but what, wa, what a lot of other fellows
have also done that doesn t mean anything, but what I m saying Is, so, CODY. Yeah, and, so we sat well that bar also has a lot of other hap-
(217)

for those reasons and everything why, I said,  Comeon Val, I ve got this
(216)
wesaid, we speculated,  Wal the fucking thing was probably pain:
somebody in Alaska, in 1910, and taken to Boston, in 1925, and now
1945, or 1948, here we are looking at the painting, in back of the Hi
... Burlesk. . ." you know...

CODY. (after silence). . . Do you feel through your shoes the ma
I'matso high, see? it took forty-five minutes after twelve o'clock,
minutes after twelve thirty  

JACK. Wow, are you high now?

CODY. Yeah, I feel it ;
JACK. We got another big. . . long. . . sonofabitch to gol
CODY. Yeah. .. yeah. . . well not really

JACK. W-whole big reel ass!

CODY. Yesh but that s nothing compared to all the things we can

any rate, her, ah, boyfriend told me why didn t I get 2 job in a parking
gh, like I. Magnin s or someplace like that, which he had once done
_years before, sol said  Alright,  and sointroduced metoa fellow down at
stem Auto Parks and!. . . went down to learn how to park cars 

|ACK. What was HE like?

YY. He wasabig fella, hisnameis, ah, geel can't remember his name,
any rate he s, he was a big fella, he was quiet, his name is Vince I
something Hke that, but he s, ah, quiet, but he's, he s pretty an
age, ah, L.A. type, it s hard to describe, 1 mean they know what's
on, the kinda wise guy type but they're really very nice, I mean
re not, ah, hungupona lat of, you know, viciousness in their make-
or anything, but he s a little bit plump, er, nice fella, very considerate
of guy, but, at the same time he knows what's going on all the time,

about, or say ?
JACK. Oh I ll that can be solved easily JACK. Y-ea-h
CODY. How?

DY. Like when I escaped out of the joint, why, he gave me a big
berating, you see! only saw hima few times but he said  What in the hell
are you stealing cars for? steal something that they can t trace, steal
something like money  and all that kind of stuff, but at any rate, after I'd
ked System for a few days they sent me up to Five eighty South Main
4ogo work for a fellow named Harvey Allerdee who was the manager of
the lot. Harvey Allerdee became my closest friend . . . and best advisor,
and I went tolive with him and his wife, she was a dancer, her name was
ivian, fat woman, with plucked eyebrows, dark hair, bout thirty-eight,
butany rate Harvey was tall fella, very red face but not like bourbon tan,
rather the red face of an outdoors man, he was always  but ah, he was
giways smiling in a very wry way, he was always doing (grimace), you
know, he was always bringing his lips back and smiling very nice, and
thenyou d say something   what it really amounted to was, ah   how he
developed that I think was from always sayin  I don t know,  or else
saying, ah, he'd say,  Well, it s up to you,   Well, Idunno,  you see, he'd,
ah, bring his face back, really very kindly looking, you know, and he had
bald head with fringe of hair but it wasn t  didn t look  didn't   think
of him as a bald man, and it seems he had freckles, he was very tall and
thin and angular, 1 mean he was ah, ah, very quiet easy-goin, never
moved fast or anything, and very good parking lot man and, ah, showed
me all the things that there was to know about. . . not only parking cars
but how to knock down and clip the customers and the company and
everybody else, and he had an old 'thirty Chevy he'd drive to work every
day, itwas quitea ways, welived about five miles away out in South L.A.,
his place out there; so ] moved in with him, and, ah, we, ah, I had areal

crazy summer, running around with a kid named. . . Rinick and sh
out lightbulbs, and shooting through the ceilings and going to jail a:
always getting hungup one way or another, but at any rate, despite
there was no, ah, it really was a wonderful summer, ah, of course th
time I was real crazy, I'd steal cars every night, when I closed the lot
midnight I'd take the best car on the lot and go joyridin, and, ah, yeah
yeah, I've dons that countless times everywhere  that's why I've stole;
least five hundred automobiles and more than that probably, see? but,
any rate, ah, Harvey was 1 can t getover Harvey, quite a guy, I can't 
but at any rate, well I keep saying  at any rate,  I don t mean to say
Harvey, ah, hed done timein a joint I finally came tofind out, andhe had

and he came over and. . . he did something which amazed me, I ca
exactly recall what it is now but he told me, for example that I was left.

(225)
LATER

CODY.  and he ran the Army prophylactic station in the P.G., in
Pacific Electric building see? (Evelyn murmurs and laughs)
JACK, Oh! (finding out where)

CODY. Sol wentin, Isaid  Say, here's a dollar,  so I said, ah,  I can take
a pro? I think, er "  He said  Oh that s alright, keep your dollar, go
ahead,  and 80, I took a pro, and, ah 

EVELYN. How'd you do that?

CODY. Well, I, ah, you see, you go over and you take this, ah, green   
tile soap you know, and you wash yourself  well most people just wash
the penis but you gotta get way down up in the asshole you know, and

 around, the balls thoroughly, be sure and get under the balls thoroug
and up inte the hair almost to the navel, see? and that's the trouble
most guys, they just, you know, they just wash their penis . . . well th
after you get it washed and, ah, dried off, ah thoroughly, then he comes
over with a, ah, plunger business, just like an eyedropper, and he sho
you how to hold your penis, hold your penis this way, see? and, and
spread {t open, and, he plunges it in, he says  Alright now. fold itl 
you hold it
EVELYN. Like an enema

CODY. So he never has to touch you or anything, and you hold it for
minutes they make you!   Army regulations, five minutes, I'veseen th
poor soldiers standin up there drunk about to pass out and everyth
still holdin that in there, you know? (laughter), and then they let it go,
course, and then (Jack makes moan) you walk out  oh then he si
you with some salve, see, you smear yourself, he never touches yo
course, himself, at all   same type of salve, you know, but, and then
put toilet tissue around that, and, walk out, but of course that  (&:
comments in background) Yeah! that's the~ that s, that s the pro
sional type prophylactic, you know; at any rate we got to talking, I ta
tothis guy. . . hisname was Destry, and he was Jesus you drank
whole thing here ~-
EVELYN. Oh  that whole thing!  Whole thing? you know how m
was in there?
CODY. (/aughing) That's what I been telling Jack all night so at
rate, ah, he s telling me, ab, oh we got talking about this and that and
told him I was Interested in philosophy, and he was interested in p!
phy, and he was innerested in Indian philosophy, and ah, so ah,
night then thereafter I'd go over and talk with him all night, there in
pro station, and ah~ 

(226)

EVELYN. I'm cold  turn the heat up

 CODY.  he told me about his  all his ideas about community living,
at getting... . people together you know, work  like, say, if you had
group, say, fifty or a hundred people, why, you don t have to work about
hours a day or something, and of course there's. . . no regulations of
kind, do whatever you want, in fact, for kicks, why you put cameras
ind the walls or somethin, but at any rate he was, ah, going through
that, and ah, in fact before he got in the Army he had already started it
y,ah ~he had adry cleaning business so he gota couple guys and couple
truckdrivers and they had it cut down toabout six hoursor four hours a
they'd work, and ah, they was all gettin interested in it in fact they
had bought the lot where they was gonna build the house, and build addi-
and everybody just. . . goof off as best they might  But he had a
of ulterior motives behind it, see? to watch the people and find out
and that and all that, but still his  the main, ah advocation of his
hich he would talk about all the time, very sensibly, and, and, give you
 {llustration that   illustration all night, was the fact that if you visualize
thing well enough and hard enough why it'll come to pass, despite odds
andeverything else  For example, he was in some terrible, ah, pa  po
portion, you know, of the Army, you know, he was in the infentry and
 something or other, and sohe. . . said to himself  What I've got to do is
to the Medical Corps.  and so, he did that, which is fairly simple
ugh, I guess, whichis about the limits most people would go, but then
e visualized himself in some soft spot where he'd be stationed there
regularly and soon and so forth and goon, and he thought of the prophy-
lactic station, and for three years he stayed in this other hospital thinking
about it, it was only one chance in a million that he'd get it and he got it
course; and things like that which he was always talking about, but
, ah, bragging, or anything of that nature, just, just simply believed
it, 30 much so that he had me walking down the street with my eyes
dosed oI could not bump into anything, you know, but just with my eyes
closed I could teil what I was doing and so on, well of course it never
worked and I only tried it once or twice, but I went to it~ but at the same
he was a technocrat, you know this technocracy, you know? 40, ah,
would go to these, ah, technocracy meetings and the, and the speaker
_would show how  like for example, victory gardens were foolish be-
cause if you put the man-hours and labor and, and the . . . bit of grass
andalltheseedsinto. . . the manufacture of, ah   why you would build,
you know, you know, understand, assembly line and all that, technoc-
Yacy, very   but at any rate, then he was. . . also   course I was inter-
ested in women and he told me that he used to be and everything, course
stillis and all that but, he ah, he, he got so absorbed in this philosophy

(227)

that now he just sat and thought all the time, when he was home, and,
on, and ah, whenever there was 2 woman around or anything why
was never, ah but he was never, wasn't anything queer about him
alloranything, he was just. . . really, ah, akind of a second-rate 1
now as | think back upon him, intelligence; ah completely con:
second-rate intelligence  concerned about . . . Indian philosophy,
so that he was all the time with it but I was with, ah, western type,

something  
EVELYN. Primitive

CODY.  of my own and so that  primitive, yeah that s, that s
so, ah, ah (sighing) he was a friend of mine for a long time, in fact I'y
forgotten all the ideas that he, ah, put across to me. Well of course th
hangover from those ideas was enough so that like when I was in
joint, er, N.M.S.R., er, New Mexico State Reformatory there, the a:
tant warden, ah, Vagila, why, he was a little interested, 80 he gave
bookslike The Law of Mentalism, by Sechnal, which, showed that if
 and soon, things like that, which is all very. . . . But ah, the wall, #
wall that Jack speaks of is not only the wail that, ah, the night that
escaped and made my way about forty miles after a day or two. .
ah... terrible, close, so that even on the street I'd be suspicious,
know. . .ah,tothis. . . parking lot expecting to find Kriloff when I'dg
thereat midnight but he just closed, and he s not there, but someone
is there, so that means he wasn t there, didn t work that night, and
looking over this wall . . . between the bus depot and the and the,
. . . parking lot on Sixth and Main. Other things about that  well,

used to arm-rassle with somebody there I've forgotten who but we'd g
oneach side of the wall there, and arm-rassle. Well, other than that
wall has never had much, ah, in my mind, except, ah, I used to
cars into it you know all day long (laughing wearily), part of my job, b
there wasno. . . wasacommon brick wall. . . (fades away). . .80

EVELYN. (who laughed) What's the wall, how did it begin?

CODY. Oh I just happened to mention the wall. He was in L.A. and

happened to see it

JACK. I wentover there and I deliberately looked at it
CODY. Oh I see (then laughs)

EVELYN. Same wall? How'd you know where it was?
JACK.  Cause he told me where it was

CODY.  I was startin to talk 

JACK.  I'd al  I had already seen it, but I didn t know 

CODY.  yeah, that s right, it's where the buses . . . line up there, see,

and the other side is where. . . the cars  
(228)

JACK. Sh  right. . . in the middle of cars. . . between them bus. ..

CODY. .. . that s right, that s right, and the other side are the cars, and
the front is a shoeshine stand, and on the other side of the front is, ah, is
. .botdog stand, ah, andin the middle of the lot is alittle shack where,
where they. . . run the cars, the guy. . . who runs the cars. . . stands
there, see; and (JACK, Yeah; EVELYN, Hmm) the lot's a small lot, very
fast lot, fast turnover, but very small easy lot, beautiful lot to work,
Jesus, because. . . it has aeck  entrance and an exit, see, most of  em
you have to send  em back out the same way they come in, but this one
they could go out the alley, see, so it s a real great lot. Most, of course I
made most money there and, had my best times there, and everything,
you know, it s a real fine lot--{ bought me a car, ran into a kid named
Rinick, and he worked at another lot for System up the road a ways, and
sohecameover   but he was very  he was Indian, very, ah, reckless. . .
guy. he didn t care about anything, but at the same time he was very. . .
quiet, and didn t. . . you know, like an Indian, see, and ah, so, I'd get
drunk with him a time or two and so we started goin up on Main Street
where the Mexican waitresses were, and, but, oneday why he was walkin
down the street, and alittle Indian girl walked by, and he she  he said
 Lbet she s Indian  although he never spoke that he was Indian or nothin
put that's what he said, and ah, so he said  Wait a minute Cody, I'll be
back  and so he walked out on the street to follow this. . . well, in fact
she wasn't pretty at all, sort of a dumpy little girl type, think about six-
teen, and ah, so he came back in about an hour with the girl and he said
 Say I don t haveacar ornothin  which he didn t have but he used to rent
cars all the time like   besides stealin them but ah, he said  Let me take
that little car that you just bought,  see? But it seems that ! had bought
thecar, which was a twenty-seven Nash with seven tires for fifty dollars,
but. . . [hada barber, special barber who did my hair, and he was also a
painter, and he said that he'd paint my car, fora   twenty dollarsorsome-
thing, in the meantime I'd use his car which was a thirty Chevy in better
shape than mine and everything, and so I just had it that day, so, Tony
said, ah,  Here's  let me use your car... . for awhile,  and I said:  Oh
__ sure," so he took the car and he didn t show up for four days, and when
he did show up course I wasn t worried about it, because I didn t have
to take it back to the barber's for two weeks or so, see, and so! was, and
1 at that time I didn t worry anyhow, | wasn't much  not that I was
reckless but 1 didn t seem to really m  | wondered where Tony was, but
  So when he did come back he d smashed in a fender, but that was
nothing, he was all full of this story about his love, see, this great  him
__ end this girl that had been together for four days, see. So they moved in
together after that, her name was Milly... huh?

EVELYN. Pretty music
(229)
witha girl, that Peggy Sneed, youknow, the one that E balled all the
and her 
EVELYN. Huh? :
CODY. Yeah, this other guy, ah, married her because he loved her,
ali that but at any rate. . . but that happened just accidentally, wes
going down very sober in fact, it was about six, seven o'clock at
goin down Slauson Boulevard, we'd just picked me up and! wasd
of course, you and so ah, Nick was sittin beside with Milly on his!
and I said, ah. . . well! started to kiss her, and ah, insteadof.. .
 Nick take the wheel,  I just with my hand pointed, at the wheel, obvi
ly thinking that he'd have enough sense to grab the wheel, but in
thought  Look at me  or  I m kissing her,  or, ah, pointin at the gi
thought   ;
EVELYN.  Watch... watch... 

CODY. So he, ah yeah, yeah,  watch,  so he started watching
_ and of course naturally no one took the wheel, Milly couldn't drive
how, so at fifteen miles an hour, we were just easing along, twenty at
most, we ren right into a telephone pole and . . . broke the girl's
Peggy's, and cut his scalp didn't hurt Milly, broke my nose. And 
any rate, they, ah --this time we come down the hill and we hit the
and it snapped the bumper right in two, you know that s pretty bad,
know, bumpers don t .. . break like that, but they did, this one,
know  cause they spring, but thisonedidn t, and, ah, so we're very di
so] gotoutand saw a flat tire and fixed the flat because I thought we
a flat but instead we had  now that I started to drive away, that to
half hour, and it was all four tires were flat! (laughs) . . . See, 80, s
started plunkin along the, ah, the we were in Pasadena and we
goin to L.A., it s about five in the morning, time to go back to work
know, and, so we're goin along very happy at two miles an hour and,
so here comes a car and then I see it's the cops and then I still say  
we ain t done nothin, may as well stop, and try to " so we got stop
L told this story before but I mean, it s what I m talking about when
tell he same thing over then you just, ah, say the words as they
your mind that you've already thought about before and so th
nothing you re not pleased by it, no one else is, but the fact is,
no, ah, spontaneity, or anything, there's no, ah, pleasure, you ses,
cause you re~you're just rehashing old subjects, see? You
(Evelyn faintly speaks to Cody) Yeah! well, ah, they got us up in court
course, ah, Nick was so mad, course I was very angry toeo but all
long he picked up this bunk, ah, that which is held from the wail by
chains, you know, see? the chain? and he'd pick it up and slam itd
pick it up, slam it down  you know, real . . . frantic, he's an indian

(232)

, and he did that, and they threatened to turn water on him and
thing you know, and what happened was he finally broke the
in, believe it or not, it came loose just at the last moment before we
going to trial at nine o'clock, s0 we went up course I won't elabar-
on all the trial, and ail my 

YN. Well that  what happened was that they got you for stolen
  didn t they?

DY. No (protesting anxiously), that wasn t @ stolen car! no it wasa
car! no they just caught us for they charged Nick with contri-
to the delinquency of a minor because he was twenty-one and the
and myself are both under eighteen see? And, ah, Phyllis as it turned
swas a reform school escapee, you know  .

ELYN. Phew

DY.  eh, no one knew that, of course, so she went back to reform
ool; and, ah, Milly was sent back to her folks in Oklahoma, and Nick
given six months, and I was given out-of-state probation, see.
speaks softly) Yeah, yeah that s what started my affair with
er J. Rock, you know, that s, ah, you know ... the attorney? the

i

ELYN. Oh, yeah

DY.  I had four different tussles with him, and we tied; I won the
one and the third one, he won the fourth one the second and the
th one. You know. But, ah, (sighing)  Oh there's a hundred things
k about, I really don t want to talk about that period because it s so,
know, in my mind, as just little things, like I say... . These things
Iremember. . . I have talked about. (Evelyn speaks softly) Yeah, |
dtobe   but I was always the quiet one of the bunch, andall that you
, Emean I wasn t see I'm more exuberant or wild or somethin
, or show-offy or whatever you might call it, you know, ah, than I
, then, I mean I wasn't that way at all, see, now I.don t do anything
sound loud, before (laughing) I used to be reckless and, and was
not quiet like this tall silent type but 1 was just normal young kid
g around you know

ELYN. Normal!

. Well, i mean, you know, normal-seeming, I'd go to work, and go
, goand try to geta girl or somethin, only thing was, these cars, and
urally all young guys in America they'll tell you, they'll   anybody
want to meet about. . . Saturday night fights or somethin, or...
or that happening, it's all the same thing, everybody's that way. . .
know, except for the fact of course I had more opportunity working
the parking lots, and like I say, that's about the only thing I got any

(233)

fun out of was driving cars. And, ah. . . . (long silence). . . Well. .
and Evelyn sort of laugh)

EVELYN. Next question?

CODY. Yeah (laughing, goofing)

JACK. (sepuichrally) Are... you ...? :

CODY. I'd just like to know what old Bull Hubbard thinks whenever
hears the  William Tell Overture  (laughing) You know? just the m
fact of the word, sometime before he gets hungup  

JACK, 1 wonder who made that up? hm?

CODY. Well, it'sa. . . it'sa, you now, some. . . writer, like Julien
come through on a press, you know, a guy'll just say  that s what it
after all, William Tell-type, huh?

EVELYN. Is that what he really did I wonder?

CODY. Well he says later  he reneged on that and said he didn't '
said it might have. . . went. . . happened that way but she put it on
head but what happened is he was just loading the gun or cleaning it
it went off or something, remember?

JACK. Yeah later . . . that s what he said 

CODY. But he never wrote, ah, to any one, has he, to really describe:
guess he's kinds afraid to 

JACK. Well you know what Val wrote
CODY. Val? no

JACK. Val King

CODY. What'd he write?

JACK. He said it was all her fault (CODY, Yeah?), that she. . . del
ately caused all this. (Yeah?) Yeah. Val of courseis mad

CODY. He must be
JACK. But he says it was ali her... her

CODY. Yeh, putthe fresh benny tubeup, and then he'd shoot, get up and
walk over, and put a tube up  very hard to hit, you know, hard to hit!
JACK. And then / d do it

CODY. Hemadeoneoutof two, oneout of three, sometimes  very good,
yee? And we couldn't hit it hardly, maybe we might hit it once; then he'd
show us how to draw all day you know, all day long he'd keep showing
how to draw the gun:  Now don''t hold it up here! Don t shoot before
you get it out! Hold it down here, hold it low, take your time, aim,  you
heard him, a hundred times, show you how to draw the gun. . .

JACK. After you left Mexico we used to draw all day

CODY. Yeah! Draw ali day! Hear that, see?  I didn't say a thing with
 him in Mexico, I'd stand right there or somethin  

JACK.  jess drawin 

CODY.  sce to see who's first, see?

JACK. --see who's first 

CODY. See?  But I got ya, now, see, I got ya Jack! that s aimed right at
yoreheart, there, right at yorebelly, see you wasalittleoff to the side here
seo? 

JACK. And she would be laughing all the time

 ODY. Yeah, so you can imagine her being around that all the time,
you know, naturally some night she s gonna say  Come here and shoot
is off my head.  It's very plausible as you think about it, you know, I
mean it's not only plausible it s just the thing you'd expect like Jack and
were catlier gonna speculate on what's gonna become of everybody,
you know, like we know what happened to June, and we know what
happened to Finistra, what's gonna happen to, say, Irwin? or what's
gonna heppen to, say, Jack, or Julien, you know what I mean?

K. Oh yeah! we didn t do that!

CODY. We didn t do that, no;  cause I didn t have any ideas. . . to talk

CODY. Jesus
JACK. Deliberately put the glass on her head and dared Bull to shoot. VELYN, Sudden death?
off  CODY. Wellnow, just as you could surmise what would happen to June

CODY. Well you know after she was walking around the room with too you could happen to surmise I suppose  

for five years while heaits there and shoots all the time, remember in LYN. Would you have surmised that would happen to June?
Orleans that. . . shootin at the Benzedrine tubes with his cap  with ' . Well you wouldn't expect her to do that, though, in the end, be-
pellet gun, you know, sit across theroom all day, and he'd sit there, se...she.. . herself is  you know, she's used to his hangup, you'd
about like where the candle bottle is. . . ik, and so she'd go, see? but we could speculate like what's gonna
JACK. We used to rush to put the fresh benny tubes up ppen to you and me somehow that way perhaps. . .

(234) (235)
EVELYN. You wouldn thave expected that to happen to Finistra
you?

CODY. No, although we were. . . talking and saying that Finistra
been looking for death anyhow, and when it finally did come he
ready for it, wasn t lookin for it, he was  8o really it s a joke on Fin
see,  cause it happened accidentally

JACK, We didn't do that

CODY. No. It s very hard, because of several things but if you  
think about it, ah, you know . . .

JACK. Well, Hubbard, boy, Idon t know what's gonna happen to him!

copy. Ijust think he will go  here s what! thought about . . -Hub

anyhow, that really nothing ever will happen to him as far as, you kn
like, he could have alot of times been hungup, and hung (laughing),
see, but instead, yeah, he'll goon and on, and go down and he'll disi

grate inthe. . . inthe heat of the tropics; that's bound to be what'll
pen, he can't come here, he can t go no place, see, he s going to go

JACK. He'll  he'll disappear into South America 

CODY. And hedoesn t wanttogoanywhere else, really, and he knowsi

(silence) That s what's gonna happen tohim
JACK. And Irwin, nothing ll happen to him either
CODY. No; he s so afraid and calculating  
EVELYN. He's cautious

CODY.  yes, very cautious, why when I was in New York there Is:
.. -wewasin this, this girl, this Josephine s house, there and everyti

we was in the bathroom, everything locked up tight and the windows
shaded and everything, you know, nobedy in there to nobody in ti
house, in the front room or nothin, just us, and we're sittingin there,
I got a roach and I m blastin it, he says  Not 0 loud! not so loud! 

know (laughter) and everything . . . (the end)
FIFTH, FINAL NIGHT
CODY. (singing, testing tape, laughing) Ehbh . . . Uncle Joe Will

andhisoctet(laughing).... Phew! Ahhh. . . I needa cigarette, Ma

.. ,Huh, doyouwantone?. . . Ah so we came over the George Was

ton Bridge, in the early morning d-a-w-n, (laughing, long pause).
there we were. . . we were we were all very tired, we went to Vi
(Jack flutes) And had a little difficulty waking her up and getting. .

(Jack flutes) (slammings of icebox) And then... ...
EVELYN. Then what?

(236)

 CODY. . . . getting her downstairs, and the thing started. We were up to
 pera few minutes and, ah, then Huck said he was tired so he stayed there,
_and Bull and I went down to the point of the Bowery, ah, way below the
 Bowery, to. . .achemical outfit down on the Battery I guess, and, ah 
qornup the music there and then the, ab. . . Il had to double park while
jvewasin there and he was gone aboutan hour, see. . . and got this chem-
jeal outfit, this. . . Bunsen burner (Jack flutes), curlicued glass tubes,
ou know, and curly s s, curly z's I guess, and, ah, oh (sighing loudly)
we had to unpack  em. . . (laughing). . .and ah, we never really started
eet them up, we   we went that night because, ah, we found June that
afternoon, she told us that, ah, that they d picked her up in the in the
railroad train, practically when she got off the train almost as though
they were looking for her, which they weren't of course, but she was just
walking around in that turrible dress of bers with Julie, and this old
woman must have turned her in or something and the . . . detectives
picked her up, and they took her to Bellevue, and she was there for an
hourortwo, three, four hours, and she was talking to the attendant there
Bellevue, the man who registered   the manager, the . . . something,
you know, Bellevue, and, and she said  Weil, my husband of course
 belongs to the University Club,  and he said  Wha, what, what? Weil?
 What? the University Club well, well my!  and he conferred with his col-
Jeague you know, and he said  Well Mrs... . Mrs. ah Hubbard, ah, we're
gery sorry that all this has happened, where could our driver take you? 
. She said- Well, better take me back down to the depot, to the train
depot, my husband s supposed to meet me there, he must be a little late,
be drove up.  So when we found her . . . someplace else but anyhow we
found her. . . but no! I do believe that was the arrangement that they'd
ade, believe it or not, Bull said  Well I'll see you up there at the depot,
when you get off the train we'll meet you up there,  and ah, and she said,
 Alright I'll wait on the on the Forty-first Street side  or something
like that, and so (laughing), they, I think in fact I remember exactly that
was it, because we went out goin into this Pennsylvania Station,
Thirty-fourth Street, see  but at any rate, ah, so we had  we went aver
on the West Side there in the Fifties by Eighth Avenue, oh about Forty-
seventh and Eighth, and. . . rented a room right in there and Harper
me up very first night and turned Bull on, you know, and Bull hadn't
bad any junk in about six weeks except that paregoric that he'd been
melting down, you know. Well man, so all his problems and everything
fas over, and June of course was having to struggle along and take care
everything, you know, and, and I'd take her out on Times Square there
that horrible dress, man, and I was, me, imagine!   ashamed to walk
with her, believe it or not, and I'd rarely I feel but I really dug it
though when we went into the cafeteria there and everybody dug her but

(237)

cki
see, and I m saying  I say officer, I m worried about the my jeep h
I m worried pr In goin to the show or something you know,
everything, and ah    He said  Ob I'l! watch it, I'l keep an eyeon it, ki
don t worry   (laughs). Phew! (laughter) So, anyhow, so, ab,
they'd have done that two or three in the meantime, ab, Huck and
occasionally Huck would rissle up, rustle up a dollar or two, and
World Series was going on, you know, soI'd spend mostof my a! terno
in the bar watching the World Series; and, ah, Huck finally got a roon
opposite the fire station on Forty-seventh and Eighth, right in th
again, ri~- right in there, see, and ah, so I slept with Huck coup
nights there, you know, and ah, he had that skin disease   he laid  
money  and June and Bull werein the same room, some little tiny room,
they didn thaveacent. . .forany reason or any kind or any anything.
Harper, actually, it was Harper I think who was laying out the dollar
two, every day, see? So, about the fifth or sixth day, why, everything wi
getting pretty frantic, and, ah, I was spending my time between here
there and up and down, onli hee ts eter sere with,
Harold Ginsberg down in the Village with Huck, you know, we fi sor chives rocm place, vso we aoce es

Thad conceived of Art Rodrigue in this fashion; Art Rodrigue the first
 baseman for the Philadelphia Pontiacs; but don t explain any further: he
was just like Al Robert, but Portuguese of course and ao invested with
that particular raw power they showed on sundrowsed porches of mid
loody afternoon, sometimes with guitars with which they imitated
American and Western kicks but were really, as only Saroyan knows,
bungon, or hung behind, their own great homeland kicks. Same with the
Canadians. . . the guitar for them was a sign of but wait, 1 was on the
Portuguese, and Art Rodrigue; for some reason too, this Art Rodrigue
was to be exactly, to look exactly, infinitely perfectly like Al Robert, the
same big tanned seriousness, like the last firstbaseman I saw, the last
ballgame! saw, so beat am I, wasa Class D league game down in Kinston,
North Carolina and where, true to God by Gawrsh, like I say, the first
baseman, H. W. Mercer, was tall and tanned and morose and serious
and mooning for Hollywood, that is, to eventually become a movie
actor, like say, Gene Bearden of the ideal minor league ballplayers of the
movies and even of Ring Anderson by Gawrsh, you know, Ring Ander-
 son, who wrote the Magnificent Andersons. Well by God, Art Rodrigue
was going to look exactly like Skippy Al Robert; and so, especially be-
 cause he wore this light cream and orange uniform of the Pontiacs his
dark face particularly glowed on the green and dazzling playingfield of

me found a ripe tomato growing among the empty whiskey bottles and
ate it raw without salt and without benefit of the Pope's advice about
salt; but (and as the races were run off to roars we couldn't see); th
names of the teams in the summerleague were Tydol, Gulf, Texaco {not
Texcoco, I wasn t with the Indian yet); Peyotl, no, not Peyotl, another
gas, to be sure not an offbrand gas, or grass, any more than I would sell
you any bad shitor Sheil you one; names (before J.C.) which were sosoft_

to make it racetrack-cool they played what were then fairly oldish

But the league, when it transpired in the afternoon, had a life of its
own; at night it no longer occupied my (me), it was the thing for next
gfternoon; at night, I was hungup on the great darkness beyond the
_ street lamp out in the dirtroad front of the house, which was under the
est hugest tree in the world, it had a SWish to it you could hear clear
to Sacramento, Calif. and I ain t talking about Compton, either; for you
know I'd never abandon my old hometown Lowell when telling what I
know about noble trees. Afternoon or evening, that tree had  em all beat.
Why, Irernember the night Mr. Hoorair from across the street got mad at
little Pinky-Winky whose name don't remember but he did something

under the tree, while the man gives him the finger and gives him hell, for
ething, as the great tree swishes over them in the high mysterious
breeze of evening. Did I dig evening? is that a question to ask? I slept on
the porch, I had covers on the swinging swing; the boughs of the great
tree did all the creaking for me; and soft the voices of the winds came
from over the grasses of Dracut Tiger Field now cooing to the wild sound
of crickets and maybe even the wild sound of a seatspring lurching in
Jovers-lane backseat of a car parked beneath homeplate pine, and dew;

the wind came across that, laden with news of upper woods and places

now and everything is happening all over at the exact moment. In the
pack is Leon Errol suddenly you think,  No this is not Leon Errol 
{he s dead) and yet he walks exactly like Leon Errol, on rubber legs, is on
sg movie lot, has a big floppy gabardine coat in which he must have gat
drunk at the racetrack in that same afternoon; the two local cops on the
best, according apparently to Hollywood custom, consented to have
their picturea taken by a member of thecamera crew, who if not delighted
was appealed upon to take their pictures; this being Leon Errol; and the
police stand passively, side by side, two blue coats, one fortyish, one a
boy cop, a thirty-year-old-married-with-two-children-might-have-been-
brakeman who instead in the brutality of his instincts migrated to the
police force, though with a mild and malleable nature and without
military ostentation; these two men, father and son in their nightly duty
and relationship in the cold torpors of Russian Hill Aaute through which
their tragic figures cut,.awinging clubs, in the rare occasions when
sesidents of the neighborhood happen to cast a bored glance from their
evening window (there being nothing to see or do in these streets,
morning, noon and night); so the cops stand there having their picture
took but suddenly and everybody watching (crowds in the cold fog, hand
in pockets, like little kids at the back end of semi-pro football games on
_gcuffled wild neighborhood fields of Saturday afternoon cold and red
and hard in the month of November in the North;) everybody in the
_crowd realizes that the Leon Errol fotografter is actually only just
fiddling with his lightbulbs and put-up arrangements of tripods and
subsidiary lights (with a cat standing next to him again wielding those
strange riddled cardboards they use for estimating the inch-ounch of
light they want, though how can anybody in a movie audience get to
detect that when the picture finally flashes on the screen;) so the cops
are temporarily and suddenly under the glare of floodlights and there
they are, they don t know what to do, perhaps they should look coply,
very well they do, folding arms, looking away. But actually at first they
waited with comradely joy while the fotog took his first bending licks at
the dark rig, with accommodating nineteenth-century buddy joy they in
fact almost locked arms, and waited, as if with mustachions and beer-
jowl, were posing for the Beanbag Afternoon Set of the German Band
Union that invites the Police Force to participate in the old days; the
dark suspicion crept now around the crowd perhaps (it certainly did on
me, I was alone, watching, Cady was at home not letting anything hap-
pen but himself, lamenting in his dark heart s house with lovemasks
and tangled flesh shrouds, as usual) that the Hollywood cameramen
ere such cynics and played such stupendous private jokes in their
vels around, that they were putting the cops to a phony hangup;
fidently however Leon Errol did snap their pictures, because when it

talked with Mr. So-and-So the producer or Assistant Camera Technician

rolling browngrass fields that at this point happen not to be in cultiva-
don, just ragged indecipherable-by-moonlight fields, and a few fences,
_ and overhanging inky trees with the ghosts of old outlaws hanging from
the cottonwood limb, and maybe a wagon standing in back of crazy-
ranch corral where maybe actually an old Italian fruiterer lives with fat-
wife and dogs but in the moonlight it looks like the corral of a cursed
homesteader; and on the soft dust of the starwhite dirtroad in the moon-

- miles an hour, scooping up a low cloud for the stars; and on the back of it
the camera, pointing backwards, handled by gumchewing California
Nightmen on the Local A.O.U.; and on the road itself Hopalong Cassidy,
in his white hat and on his famed pony, loping along intently with beck
and bent, holding one rein up daintily, stiffly, like a fist, instead of
banging to the pommel; grave, bemused in the night, thinking thoughts;

landscape; the great hairy trees of its night; then through a sudden splash

no good, the mind doing this, then letting the soul rebound softly and say
 No, no, everything is really alright, that was paranoia, that was just a

Inside the secret of the dung, and the flit-flies in the drowsiness,
Cody saw the possibility that he might have taken that wet cowflap and
thus ripened it like an autumn. . . he rolled his hoop past his thought.
But there was nothing ridiculous, there were no images immediately
and sensationally ridiculous; it was just a matter of believing in his own
soul; it s just a matter of loving your own life, loving the story of your
own life, loving the dreams in your sleep as parts of your life, as little
children do and Cody did, loving the soulof man (which I have seen in the
smoke), lilting in yourown breaks to make them good and bad according
to the geography of the day which included (for him) those Santa Fe drive
junkyards not far from the overpass aurmounting the rooftops of Den-
ver Mexicotown.  But we came,  said Cady,  to the garage at twelve
o'clock just like Old Bull Balloon had told us, and there he was, old Bull,
 upstairs with all those guys and his hatbands all laid out crazy on his
arm, and we said, well, wup, well, but the fact of the matter was  
(thinking as the clock ticks)   that dung you talked about, that dung, in
fact, yes, and I also used to listen to Amos  n  Andy

and was just beginning tolearn the things that would eventually lead
through the mazes of the mind growing to all kinds of realizations
when a thing is ridiculous it is subject to laughter and reprisal, and
be cast away like an old turd in front of the pearly old pigs of thes
thing gone dead. There were no images springing up in the brain of
Pomeray that were repugnant to him at their outset. They were all
ful. There was a clarity and pureness in his mind. Someday he w

wide-spaced octaves in which as upon the Pillar of the Arcades of Jazz,

mergeinto the great Abstraction that is coming   Abstract war (as now),

later), Abstract drama, and the Abstract novel, and Abstract modern

strange vast five-act dramas replete with funny characters abstracted
from Blakeian ravings he wrote in the streets and on the gallows at mid-

the property of the Crown? Who will know the fate of Brew Moore whom

with his arms knocking, you have to look again before you are frightened

a system of nerves that inform him of the catastrophe or, the roses

old horn, learning the first modified woodshed rudiments of raw
joy which is American jazz, the song, the great whistling song, whistling
into your horn and holding your horn high, aware all the time of the
takes you can make and at the same time realizing the dreariness of
moments it consumes to realize this and letting the song, the song pa
you by; then raising your horn, horizontal like Lester and Lee Konits,
and blowing intoit, whistling outofit, out of its iron, the perfect harmon:

were in our prime and clarifying adulthood then, our clear-bell decisive
years, what a laugh if it's really true).  Now wait a minute Helen. . . .

dress, or oyster pie, a fetishist hiding in a closet, he must have spent
whole afternoons simpering in the bathroom. Arriving in Sacramento at
nightfall, these dull people decided to sleep, the trip half started. All the
way to Sacramento Cody and I had terrified them by talking as we did in
the backseat, wild and crazy, just like we were both seeing red; in fact I

was. The excitement between us was so immense and extraordinary,
and we had so little recognition of the fact that these people were there
oreven in acar, that at one point we were rocking the car back and forth.

 Hey you're rocking the boat,  complained the husband from upfront

where a conversation was going between the three of them, probably
about us who were completely deaf to anything but ourselves. We were
talking about the Great Scythes of our childhood, when I, riding in New
England littleroads with boulders and posts and hills of vine all along,
would, imaginary, cut it all down with my scythe as my father swept the
car by; and he, Cody, in the tragic red roads of Sunday afternoon in

SOMETHING INTERESTING there is in Cody s ability to make me, or
his wife, sad, and even friends! watched: is he showing the sadism of the
big powerful face he had bucking through the Montana storms of earth,
when I, with him, was faced by the wild dismalities of a universe
severe the only thing is to grimly bear and buck it. Tenderness has 5
room; tenderness hasno sadness. Cody is sad. He makes us sad. There
nothing inexpressibly sadder than that old photo of his father s 1921
house-built-on-e-truck he rattled from West Virginia to West Dakota
for no reason whatever; baby Cody is in the picture, pudgy, swaddled

Well, Cody is always interested in himself: from behind his iron bars

mysterious at night because none of it laps on the shore, it s bedded in a

Dark Laughter has come again

I ve pressed up girls in Asheville saloons, danced with them in road-
houses where mad heroes stomp one another to death in tragic drive-
ways by the moon: I ve laid whores on the strip of grass runs along a
cornfield outside Durham, North Carolina, and applied bay rum in the
highway lights; I've thrown empty whiskeybottles clear over the trees
in Maryland copses on soft nights when Roosevelt was President; I've
knocked down fifths in trans-state trucks as the Wyo. road unreeled;
I've jammed home shots of whiskey on Sixth Avenue, in Frisco, in the
Londons of the prime, in Florida, in L.A. I've made soup my chaser in
forty-seven states; I ve passed off the back of cabooses, Mexican buses
and bows of ships in midwinter tempests (piss to you); I've laid women
on coalpiles, in the snow, on fences, in beds and up against suburban

in, at a party; she said  I always wanted to meet a real cowboy

nothing left. I'm depressed. I sit at home and listen to the slamming

Island freights and think of worries of all kinds. Cody s in his bathrobe,
the Chinese one, composing an epic novel:  Cody Pomeray was born
Feb. 8, 1926, in Salt Lake City.  I help him edit it under the cockroaches.
We go to Birdland, there's Sonny Stitt whaling.

But when Spring comes I want to leave New York, I gotta hear the
bird of Shenandoah whistling, I take off for Mexico City via Lexington,
Virginia and Stonewall Jackson's grave, and Denver. I m in Denver,
preparing to go south by rail, when Cody suddenly appears in a 1937
Ford jalopy. What'd he do? to come rattling back West across the
Plains, alone, 1800 miles? Why, he threw up everything; but actually
he was headed for Mexico City for a divorce from Evelyn, but not as No.
3 thought so he could husband her, rather to return to Evelyn dis-wed or
uppity-wed, all wed and inter-wed.

Mexico was the last great trip. But it began in Denver.

IT BEGAN IN DENVER in a little Ford model 1937   Model T T-Zone,
V-8  flying and rattling south. It was Cody s return to his native city, he

stood on porches with a coat over his arm, rocky and stern. He goofed
with local ex-athletes in round-the-town high cars at | a.m. 1 was there,
up front with Slim Buckle and Tom Watson, others in back, we all got
high on Dave Sherman getting his first kicks on tea: he kept slapping his
knee and laughing, yelling, squealing,  Sonofa bitch god damn.  Mad,
Cody loved him and at nine o'clock in the morning polite important
suburbanites of Denver, while cooking their bacon and eggs, could hear
great subterranean  Yesses  rumbling from the earth, from the cellar
where I lived, where Cody and Sherman sat in a bed talking about every-
thing. It was the first time that any of the Denver group represented by
Dave ever dug Cody. There was a master and student relation, for forty-
eight hours. Sherman was just an ordinary Denver guy who'd been high-
jumper in high school, four years in the service, six months in an office,
now didn t know what to do. Meanwhile Cody conducted a complicated
affair with acrippled girl across town, she almost followed us to Mexico.
Sherman's father, fearful of his son s departure, an unhappy old man
like the unhappy old men of French movies and real life, all rheumy and
wasted and immitigably gloomy in brown darknesses of afternoon par-
lors. . . so frightened was he of the magic sound of Cody s name on
Dave s lips when he announced he was leaving for Mexico, that, when I
showed upto help Dave with luggage, the old man insisted on calling me
Cody. (Cody had goofed an entire party, given in honor of a local young
writer, with his idiotic behavior in company, Lord knows he'll do any-
thing, he fingered his balls, he grabbed the hostess, cake spluttered from
his mad activities laughing up and down the dish line, he charmed and
bemused half our lives away, all kinds of emotions ran riot in the room,

saw a dot decreasing in size and it was still Ed Gray, watching us go to
Mexico, Two miles outside town, all our suitcases intact, Sherman is bit
by a bug; it comes from golden Colorado wheatfields, it s like home, but
his arm swells poisonously, we have to buy penicillin in San Antone. Now
the moon like a fevered bulb arises, New Mexico is hot under the stars,
dew-cold; there's Dalhart, Texas burning far across the horizon, we'll be
there by dawn light; the moon hugens in the sky, a fatted calf, leans its
skewered castrative eyes on a nob, poor good moon; we're rolling to
Mexico. Fantesize us no Samarkands. This is the New World. The spine
of America runs deep down. . . .  Think of it, boys, we'll be rolling bean-
bugging down the continent and over the rolling world   a frightening
thought, Time, and Space so vast anyhow; why did God leave us on this
ledge? and didn t warn us a bit? God created a sin. He sins, we die.
We're rolling down along, Pueblo, Trinidad, Raton Pass and soft
roll of rocks in truck midnights, a hamburger; anthropologist campfire
off the road marks where the anthropologists of our youth are telling
their life stores, as we in the car are doing. Cody recalls childhood oc-
eastons when he must have met Dave.  When I was covering the alleys up
by Cherry L used to doublecheck by your house  cause I always found 
you must have seen me, I'd bounce a ball sometimes, seems like I seen
you, on a bike, or somethin, but at any rate.  And here we're three
gringos rollingin the summer night to Mexico, by moon.  Keep her rollin,
boys,  yelled Cody from the backseat sleep,  we'll be kissin senoritas
b'dawn.  We spent a whole day traversing downwards through Texas,
eternities of bush, Coleman, Brady, hot, dusty; at one point I thought
Cody was something else and the car a celestial wagon when I dropped
off to doze at his side in the afternoon; a grueling huge journey. I drove
some; Sherman leaned on the wheel through interminable counties.
Texas! At Abilene we saw the red faced Texans crossing their hot white
pavements. After Fredericksburg (where Cody, Joanna and I had
crossed in the snows of 1949 with eyes on the West) it was the cool of
evening, a gradual general descending to San Antonio; that dawn had
been Amarilloin the buffalo plains, the whipof flags at great gas stations,
the windy panhandle grasses. Here it was evening, and the heat in-
creasing as the plateau gives off to the level of the Rio Grande. Lights get
browner, darker, you can tell Mexican territory long after; San Antoniois
humming and buzzing and fragrant in a tropical night. While Sherman
gets his shot at the hospital, Cody and I walk the Mexican verdurous
shacktown streets, looking for girls, shoot some pool in local Mex hall,
play records at juke, Wynonie howling  I Love My Baby's Pudding,  the

among border rats and disappointed cops. Off we go into Mexican guards

Wecame into Mexico on tiptoe. As the officials checked we saw that
across the road, where they said Mexico began, Mexico did begin, with
 the late sitters of the night, some of them on chairs and it's 3 a.m., one
cabaret chili joint is open, beer's there, etc., we see that Mexico is the
land of night. There are young men as well as old men standing in the hot

inexplicable and creative. We flew down the land. The old car managed
nicely. We began getting high to miaprove our vision. In the first set of
tropical mountains, high above the great yellow ribbon of the river, Rio
Moctezuma that dug its canyon forever, near Tamazunchale the brown
and fetid foothill town, we stopped on a mountain ledge off the road to
think and talk. Tome the great verdant valleys rising on both sides in mad
slopes covered with aerial agricultures of the mountain planting tribe,
yellow bananas gracing the mountaintops, was all small and green and
funny like a child dream I was so high: the hugeness of the world became
a joke in my mind, I thought these mountains were all in one quiet and
massive room; I told this but they didn t understand: but Times Square
toois in one livingroom of Time. At a little town to which we descended I
saw acomer  dobe two-story apartment or tenement and as clearly asa
bell it was true, to me, that was the house where I'd been born, they took

We slept in the jungle, a ghostly white horse came trotting out of the
jungle woods in the pitch of night, Cody was. on the sand road in a
banket, the horse phosphorescent and aflame in the dark came, meek
longfaced ghost, tippy-toe past Cody's sleeping head, pursued by mangy
Jungledogs barking, continuing on across town (the humble little Limon

bananas and flies and barefoot kidsistera in the happy gloom of Fel-

has already crumbled in a rubbish heap they want banks. 

Cody gave a little girl his wristwatch in exchange for  the smallest
and most perfect crystal she s picked from the mountain just for me"; ag
a rule those went for five cents or less.  Damn, I wish 1 had something
to give them," muses Cody.  Isn't there anything I can give them?  he
mightas well shout at the mountains; no answer. We receive pineapp
for fractionsof a penny: no fair exchange at all. The Indians are loung
against alpine stonewalls on the ledges of light, hatbrims down, draped,
shrouded in dark and dusty vestments. Biblical patriarchs bless
and convene with crowds in the deserted dusty ghost town mi
squares of late afternoon; women flow along the fields with flax in th
arms, striding, talking; from out the wild Judean earth showers thev
maguey pulque octopus of cactus, ready to stab and suck. Jeremiacal
hobos lounge, shepherds by trade, under groves of dark trees in the w

Cody saw angels of heaven through everything, in Mexico. Hour

after hour, sick with repugnant life he drove on and yet endured. At

Actopan, or Ixmiquilpan, or Zacualtipan, I don't know which, where
we passed, there was a crowd of Indians in robes standing in the sun

atall the shepherds of the Bible in the sun of antiquity,  he takes one look

Ford like that, as if to goop the loop. Across from that rocky village with
ts cactus foundationsis anearthof the young Jesus; they're bringing the

goats home, long-stepping Pantrio comes fumilgating along the maguey

But not so sick with repugnant life, cheesy Cody in his beat down

Ford rottinon up the fard, with Mexican saints and peons watching him.
Whata land!   We rose for the plateau whereon Mexico City sits; it was
gradual, those Biblical levels in between, those sweet lands terminated,
just a step up, by monasteries, like the progress of the history of the
church, and the town and thecity, till wereach the San Juan Letran chap-
els and cathedrals of the great city night. There is a stupid blur in my
memory of the trip; I think Cody remembers ebsolutely nothing  either
that or all.

CODY HAD ONE MOTHER, but she had seven sons. And, like me, he
Hnned against his father; he left him flat in Ogden, I left my father flatin

grasses and pisses in the day, a lawn behind him, a rose arbor, the
Denver afternoon where those immortal clouds ever roam to their
mountains. Nothing has changed in the skies over Colorado since 1931  
But now Cody is grown big and rocky and gaunt and manly in his doom.
Hope expresses itself in the composition of flowers, light and leaf in the
background of Cody ateleven, hisarma are folded complacently but with
expectancy, he grins for camera, his hair is brushed to one neat school-
boy side, he has suspenders and bicycle boy stripes on his long pants, a
clean white shirt is folded in a square at the elbow  In his eyes all this
human belief, at eleven there's belief (1937) which is gone and instead
should have ripened. Has it not ripened?

We come driving into Mexico City; (how do we know?).

Great excited soccer fields of dusk and windwhip first attracted our
attentions; outside on the plains, outside town, where monasteries mix
serritories of agriculture with haciendas and wineries, we feel that wind
for real, 1 blast on the plain under a roaring tree huge a hundred foot,
with my eyes fixed on that pinkwalled creamy monastery across the way
haunted by afternoon shapes in shrouds, bearing apples; now that wind
that from vineyards got grained, blew blasting across the suburban
 Mexico City outlying factory soccer fields with huge commotions and
settlements in between whaling like mad and the treffic refusing to halt.

 Look at  em kick!"

And oh the sad streets
in lost adobes,

 It's nothing,  says Cody not listening. From far away the curse

you gonna do?  Nothing. In a few weeks  less than that  after one of

Cody satat kitchen table in the Mexican Indian Night Gloom and packed
to go. I had a fever that night from dysentery and only vaguely noticed

Ford.  All that again?  I say to Cody hearing of his departure. . . . mean-

now drove back, north, right out Insurgentes the way we come in, Ferro-

biblical plains by the first starlight the wise men made. Far across the
dewy cacti the coyote crowed his oats with a long dog grin, a burly sack
hung from a nail, an ikon flickered in the tree, the wines of repentance
flowed in the stream. Bent over his wheel like a madman, shirtless, hat-
less, the moon leering on his shoulder, the apex of the night sweeping
back in a fast shroud, he unrolled his old Ford joint by cracking the door
over the humps and billdales of the Pan American Hiway through the
Fold and Void of Earth Old . . . poor Crafeen, he made his mew in a
churchyard marble pew. The bow! of Old Okiah, flung from northern
lips of stars, caromed from the baldy temple of the Lazy King; they
brought news of a tune. Feverishin his middies, here he goes crackowing
across the desert and back to Texas up; alone now and in inky night he
redone the mountains and the passes, he passed the parapets and cre-
vasse dwellers in their apron of night. Did he see any lights?

valleynight when we eased up at a gas station, and drank a few cold
beers from an icebox next to pumps, various Mexicans doing same in
their peregrinating on the sidewalk so green, I thought, in all that wild
delight and tropic love, a pity I should be seeing the wildest and most

the gaspings of his direction-leaping conscience: he flew back across the
US. in the airplane night (his first ride) comtemplating the tragic mis-

IN VICTORIA Cody Pomeray, his headlights pointed to the corner of a
yard as he waited for his boy Victor who went in for a minute to find out
if his sister knew his wherabouts whether fiesta dance or pulque saloon
or mambo dive in peanut and Sunkist counter back by Tequila Square;

(389)
like a sonofabitch, it s time to say s0, as, in Chicago we saw the children,
of the modern jazz night blowing their horns and instruments with belief;
it was Lester started it all, the gloomy seintly serlous goof who is behind
the history of modern jazz and this generation like Louis his, Bird his
to come and be his fame and his smoothness as lost as Maurice
Chevalier in a stagedoor poster his drape, his drooping melancholy
disposition in the sidewalk, in the door, his porkpie hat ( At sessions
allover the country from Kansas City to the apple and back to L.A. they
called him Porkpie because he'd wear that gone hat and blow in it ) 
what doorstanding influence has Cody gained from this cultural master
of his generation? what mysteries as well as masteries? what styles,
sorrows, collars, the removal of collars, the removal of lapels, the crepe-
sole shoes, the beauty goof, the -one night I saw Lester, in a reverie on

Lester, early heroisms in a room, records of Lester, early Count, suits

twenty years behind him, and Lester blows all Kansas City to ecstasy
and now Americans from coast to coast go mad, and fall by, and every-
body's picking up  what? This had no effect on Cody? he who stood
beside me listening to Lester's Children in Chicago, he who hung in a
_ doorway waiting for his connection (with me dragged millionaires to
_ hear Lester).  Dig him,  Cody says with a sneer when we see Lester, just
after Chicago, just before Mexico City, at Birdland, and Lester sneers at
him from bandstand; this is the mark of the hip generation,  I'm hip,
man, I m hip.

dolorous, thus did Cody   heis connected with Lester, allour horns came
down. Tragic muling catl on screechy hincty fence by cotton cloth and
pin  In his ripest period Lester had let his horn half down and his head,
consequently, because he didn t adjust mouthpiece, fell over ninety
degrees in sadness; then finally, in his Baroque late hornings in the open
void of American Nightclub, he'd let the horn fall all the way, adjusted
the mouthpiece only in relation to the first fall, and hangs there, ninety
degrees, largefaced, sad, blowing clich s in a masterfuland cool manner,
his hair long, his forearm busted, his shoes thick and crimson rich now
{like chemical milk foam plastic rubber couches) instead of those old
galoshes of his cartoon Born-thirty-years-too-soon youngmanhood in

ORT OF ONE TRIP Cody took to New York and the East Coast as if
hewanted tosee for the last time if there was any fame worthwhile and
decided not so, he came among us for no reason and without warning;
successfully married down with Evelyn for the past entire six months

_  Wal,  says Cody,  I'll go back alone then?  It appeared so, strange  
_ put he was only in New York three days, I saw (in fact) little of him, was
_ pusy; he hooked upinother activities. . . already we weren'ton speaking
_ terms any more, old buddies of the night grown sad, just like once exuber-
ant basketball quintets meeting in sad maturity hotel lobbies with their
_ shamefaced wives (in Worcester). He had brought his heavy topcoat to
New York winter, we walked by the tracks under clouds of perfect white
steam and he said  Whoo! I'd forgot how cold the East is, cald as a son-
_ gmbitch, damn. I m going back to California there. 

 Back to Evelyn, huh? 
 What else, boy? Diane won't have me; I tried my best, I pleaded with
her seven hours straight, live at the end of Watsonville chain gang; I'll
be in most every morning, get hers, one night with one, one with the
other; women just don t understand.  So he went back to his wife and
daughters.
 Don't know why I came,  he finally admitted cheerfully; he was
through with New York, though; it wasn t made for Cody Pomeray. It
takes a raw wild young town   if any exist, if Frisco, I mean San Fran-
cisco, d   We clapped hands in a gloom   we posed for a picture in a gray
square; Cody s all stern and hardjaw, his hand s inserted in his Levi
pocket like the upside down hand of a Napoleon and like a Gay Nineties
banker and like a long lumberjack in a rangy mountain town, fingers
board in, thumbs at ease out, his big hardbelt, workshirt severe and
even military, and big square mountainous determination and sim-
plicity face (like a dumb Canook), already raveled frowns in his head,
poncerns, lines, worries, the might of muscular righteous agreement
with the self... that s Cody.
  You Can Depend on Me,  man, that s the name of the record,  said
Lionel,  when Lester was really blowing and generated this excitement
which was so tremendous, I've never known anything like it here in the
United States  except perhaps, maybe, man, you know, when Cody, on
his last trip, when he came for no reason, and went back, remember?

 But why are you going?  poor Evelyn asked. Cody had no idea and
all his answers were unsatisfying but he came, and fluted overland
like a Zenzi witch King in his dragoon, and arrived in New York for
exactly the third time in his life. How far this was from that first
trip with rosy Joanna in 1946! those bus dreams they'd shared, the
